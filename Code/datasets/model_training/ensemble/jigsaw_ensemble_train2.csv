0,Re Patron Saints of Places I noticed on the Talk page two separate comments going back a few years that the page would be more user friendly if the listing was according to Place Accordingly I ve been trying to re sort the entries towards that end I ve been making the changes in what I hope are manageable bits partly because it s very time consuming and I don t want to lose anything particularly the citations and partly because I ve been waiting for someone to object I take it from your welcomed feedback that I may proceed As far as the other patron articles In general since an article on any individual saint would indicate their various areas of patronage geographic and otherwise I think the over all listings would be better grouped by topic However those pages seem somewhat less pressing because at least they are separated alphabetically whereas I found the Places page a bit confusing particularly because a number of the historical places are now known as something else I am going to see if I can find some images as well unless there is a rule against images and lists On another note I was looking for a clean up listing for the Saints portal but the one I found dates back to 3 12 10 Is there a more current one somewhere I noticed your comment on the WT X talk page and I would be interested in helping out a bit on Advent Christmas content if you like appreciate the input Mannanan51,0.003537716,0.010650561,0.00044430158,0.0005755745,0.0013996483

0,Issues Well I am very displeased with this article and with wikipedia for not wishing to ensure that all sides of the issue be reported on this sensitive topic The integrity of this article is only about a 50 out of 100 I too have added information to the introduction of this article lending mere existance to the fact that global warming is still disputed by some and it too has dissappeared or was even removed by wikipedia I believe that enough discussion has occurred here as per their request to warrant that tiny tidbit of informaton being sited fairly in the INTRODUCTION of this article alongside the rant in the INTRODUCTION that argues for global warming If Wikipedia cannot do something so simple and fair and chooses to support silencing those whose views are contrary to their own as a supposedly fair balanced and factual encyclopedia I will have to boycott further use of this resource because it s no resource when the information in it is purposefully skewed and where the encyclopedia takes actions that blatently support the skewing of information and the omission of facts Wikipedia monitors this article has has repeatedly removed such additions that alter the single sided position of this article for one my own addition Therefore wikipedia I request once again that this information be added and it s evidence for that sited WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND WITHOUT DEMEANING LANGUAGE in this article as this is only fair and factual My previous changes are on file and I would not mind them being replaced The controversary section isn t enough because it s language is clearly demeaning to any idea that does not support global warming and the introduction starts out stating it as a fact without lending weight to other views I don t have a problem with calling global warming a fact I simply want it stated that it is a fact that many people still dissagree and have good evidence to support that idea Just because Al Gore thinks we re headed for death doesn t make it so as was pointed out in the last post here that just because a leader says that everyone agrees with him doesn t make it true I remind you that plenty of action groups left wing radical groups and individuals non existant scientists and other disreputable groups and people have also supported global warming and therefore I want to state for the record that just because an oil tycoon signs against global warming doesn t mean everyone who does isn t credible You never hear about the 10s of thousands of scientists that dispute it but 1 that agrees with GW he makes the front page Anyway I come down hardest on wikipedia because they re the host of this article and it is their responsibility to make sure its integrity is maintained and there they have failed in my opinion Borghuman See Wikipedia Undue weight although I personally have no problem with mentioning that there are people willing to deny facts it s on about the same level as ignoring claims of people who still believe the earth is flat A mention would do no harm however,0.11219719,0.015023777,0.0029755433,0.0006351788,0.0018514788

0,This is the most ridiculous nonsense ever I honestly think that whoever is doing this needs to be reported to Wikipedia How can a local newspaper to Egremont which is completely free of charge and carries important and relevant stories to the town be removed What possible reason can you have other than I personally don t like links You are denying visitors to the page a relevant source of information about the town those visitors sought out on Wikipedia because of some petty and childish desire to seem official You really should ask yourself whether removing this link was beneficial to visitors to Wikipedia or whether you just denied them a source of relevant information,0.07726795,0.03183646,0.0023424728,0.0006297418,0.0012905385
0,Notability of Michael Fout A tag has been placed on Michael Fout requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person organization band club company etc or web content but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable that is why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia Under the criteria for speedy deletion articles that do not indicate the subject s importance or significance may be deleted at any time Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable If this is the first page that you have created then you should read the guide to writing your first article If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the article s talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but don t hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject s notability under Wikipedia guidelines For guidelines on specific types of articles you may want to check out our criteria for biographies for web sites for bands or for companies Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this,0.024591062,0.017502084,0.0031357822,0.0005693544,0.0016199157

0,Unfortunately I don t know the literature on this field that well just the general background So I know how most of the techniques work who some of the experts are on a couple of the topics and I can point out if a particular source doesn t seem to understand the science But I would say that it s too broad a topic and not enough is known for it to be covered in the scientific literature as a single unit That said these reviews might be useful please let me know if I can explain anything for you I ve just added them to a couple of articles so you may come across them in Wikipedia as well I can also recommend more sources on any specific topics of interest Gene therapy is the field that s furthest along Related articles of interest include vectors in gene therapy aka delivery methods and genome editing There are also techniques such as SCNT where the entire nucleus is replaced this is how Dolly was cloned but I hesitate to consider those genetic engineering Another field that comes to mind is regenerative medicine although that article isn t nearly comprehensive This and the related field of tissue engineering mainly focus on applications such as the growth of organs for transplant starting from stem cells However it doesn t currently use much genetic engineering the closest it gets is genetic reprogramming I was extremely surprised to find that article didn t exist I ve just created it As far as I m aware the use of genetic engineering to give humans new traits as opposed to prevention or cures is mostly speculative although the techniques should apply in the same way Synthetic biology is the closest in that it attempts to devise new traits but it s still just beginning and is extremely far from any application in humans I imagine that most of the descriptions of technology will be like this not yet applicable to humans but could be in the future other than that which applies to human cells in culture The scope of the article is uncertain to me Most of the sources that use human genetic engineering as a viable description discuss ethics rather than science Of course the ethics is important as well but my familiarity is with the science There is a lot of scientific detail that can be discussed but as I mentioned above the science itself doesn t usually use such a broad categorization The science is moving quickly An article written in 2012 may have a significantly different background context from one written in 2011 Modification is easiest at the zygote or blastocyst stage There is a bit of information on how this is done at transgenic mouse It s not done in humans of course There are a lot of people who use language such as the next stage in human evolution This is something I removed from the article I think I also saw it in a couple of respectable sources when I was editing this page but it s at the least imprecise poor wording and at least in my opinion should be attributed if included It is valid under a broader definition where evolution simply means change over time but it implies some mechanism of progress or goal directedness stages so it is somewhat misleading when applied to biological evolution which doesn t have these properties I won t be available much for at least the next few days but please let me know if you have any questions If it s more than a week please feel free to remind me on my talk page since the message will drop off my watchlist,0.0035970907,0.012898963,0.0003602495,0.0005799286,0.0013922482

0,reason I think another admin needs to look at this case firstly the user GoodDay has sexually offensive comments on his talk page i asked him about it and he then quickly deleted them to try and cover his tracks but they still are on his log after this out of anger hes been stalking me and pasting my IP address all over wikipedia and hes done this for well over 2 weeks now sorry but this isn t normal behaviour this guy has an obsession my brother then with me i then called him a pervert becuase he clearly is one and i get banned Other users have also left comments on his userpage telling him to stop stalking them and stirring up trouble One of the main reasons i had to quit wikipedia was becuase the user GoodDay kept stalking my userpage and my edits pasting around my IP address and causing trouble for me and keep talking about my brother i don t know if this user is racist but my brother has had a problem with him i feel unsafe on here also If you checked my contributions for wikipedia over the last 2 years you would realise i have added far more than any of those users on the ANI board i have no idea why i got banned for calling GoodDay for what he truly is if you check the chatlogs you would see he has spouted out many abusive insults i do not insult people i just call it as it is i accept a 2 week ban then but please tell GoodDay to stop stalking my userpage leaving me messages and pasting around my Ip address and spreading lies about my brother he seems to have an obession with this is clearly all against wiki policy and abuse also note i am most likely getting the local authorities in on this issue 86 10 119 131,0.54230446,0.0075433743,0.0037421782,0.00087726396,0.002932806

0,I guess JFD is trying to discourage you to get in touch with me via e mail since he fears some kind of academical threat Just to clear some things up I was not the guy who went India did not exist until 1947 I would never post something as blunt offensive and ignorant as that However yes I have changed a few things around as a correction It is not to offend anyone but like Kenneth Tennyson and his devoted sidekick JFD the Green Hornet and Kato I too have some historical points of views I understand that you have been accused of being a pan Indian nationalist while I have been accused of being a Tamil nationalist As far as Indian martial arts are concerned martial arts from both your culture and mine are in the Indian martial arts section Therefore it effects both of us It seems like through this wiki conflict it has thrown us together into one pot If I am here to put you or your culture down or to discredit India why in the first place would I have stuck up for you I had not intentions in mind when I did that It just ticked me off when Kenneth sent you that messed up message Just like for example a few years ago when a Punjabi store owner was beaten up in a hate crime I was outraged I see you have a vast knowledge in the fighting styles of Northern Inda while I have the same for Southern India Likewise you are very knowledgeable about ancient Bharat and its 16 Mahajanapada Republics while I have the same for ancient Tamilakkam Since this page on Indian Martial Arts effects us both maybe together we can combine our knowledges to present a remarkable page Yes I do understand our passions which may sometimes clash However if we could set aside some of that and work together in a give take mentality we can make things work At the same time we will present our contributions which may be opposite of what JFD Kenny think but at the same time their views shall be presented as well to give a fair and balanced view on Indian Martial Arts Do you agree with me on this If so it would be nice if we could communicate via e mail I have more ideas to share with you I believe we can make this work As far as JFD is concerned I do not know what his intentions are Maybe he feels a little threatened of the possiblity of you and me teaming up on this project or maybe I am wrong,0.6854045,0.006273017,0.0029411903,0.0022157603,0.005989402
0,David on a personal note you are an erudite man How can you of all people advance pseudoscience I repeat even Nobel Laureates are at odds with Complexity Science and that is for non sentient systems but you are advancing Cynefin for interacting humans as a reality You know well that it fails evidence based management tests that you would subscribe to for any other material You are falling into your own trap whereby you are right as long as you believe it but others are wrong about other similar metaphorical models I notice it doesn t stop here You write in such an erudite fashion yet are overtly a practicing mystic see your status page Roman Catholic You know far more than me as a Professor that the lack of evidence does not de facto mean an existence deity to be Why do you draw the line between mysticism and reality David As for me I draw it where Prof Richard Dawkins draws it where all other eminent scientists draw it There must be evidence it must satisfy scientific criteria to be valid Cynefin as well as that other belief of yours fails the test But you are a Profesor so you know that far more than me So from a psychological perspective why are you advancing this model You know others were very erudite too like Freud Jung Sir Arthur Conan Doyle etc Freud was a doctor yet advanced nonsense as truths Jung was a learned man yet advanced and strongly believed in Spirits ghosts and so forth You are not in that vague field psychology but a Professor of stronger field with knowledge of business So why are you advancing pseudoscience,0.1244229,0.006987164,0.0022151046,0.000595177,0.0024964332

0,joshbuddy your editing leaves me gasping Your Lead in is not only void of verification it also presents several outright false statements and seriously misrepresents other items 1 The statement that Jehovah s Witnesses teach that blood is sacred and must not be eaten or transfused whole is grossly misleading because all Jehovah s Witnesses do not teaching this and your statement implies all of them do Hence this statement of yours misrepresents 2 The statement This view was put forward by the second president of the Watchtower Joseph Franklin Rutherford not only lacks verification it is just plain false Rutherford did not teach that blood per se was sacred and he never condemned blood transfusion 3 The statement Beginning in 1980 the medical use of certain products derived from blood became permissible is not verified and it is just plain false Watchtower doctrine tolerated some products derived from blood as early as November of 1961 which was only ten months after blood transfusion became a shunning offence 4 The statement there is evidence that some Jehovah s Witnesses have secretly taken medical products derived from blood or blood transfusions is a patent misrepresentation Verifiable source material demonstrates that some Jehovah s Witnesses have also openly accepted blood transfusion 5 The statement The non acceptance of blood products by groups like the Jehovah s Witnesses has caused many hospitals to offer bloodless medicine is another horrible misconstruction When it comes to the Watchtower organization s blood doctrine there is no other similar group and you have not referenced one either Your statement manifests a serious lack of qualification to address this subject You manifest ignorance of the subject and a willingness to edit despite that lack Hence I have reverted to the verified introduction which feeds nicely into the article as a whole You have yet to answer questions asked of you in relation to the verified Lead in language will you ever,0.010672884,0.00497702,0.08961131,0.0010618302,0.010319676

0,May 2012 UTC Rob Schnautz WMF what I meant by bringing up the Okeyes WMF example was that he was hired to complete a specific task i e to get the community involved in the development of the New Page Triage WP NPT and the Article Feedback Tool Version 5 So his task was clear to us Since he is the point man the go to guy It s very easy to get information from him He has the two tool talk pages his newsletters and holds office hours on IRC chat And email plus he responds readily and to the point on his talk page There s no confusion Everyone knows what s going on If he can t give a direct answer he might say something like I have no control over that I ll ask the developers if your proposal is possible and get back to you He is really clear about what he can do and what is out of his hands up to the developers or WMF or technically not feasible etc I appreciate that you and Ldavis WMF are community liaison people but I only learned about you recently and I m not sure what sorts of things you cover or what it would be appropriate to contact you or Ldavis WMF about I found out accidentally about Dennis WMF or what ever his name is because I got involved with copyvio issues and I knew Moonriddengirl handled that kind of stuff etc That s the first I learned of WMF editors around My big beef which I ve gotten over was a problem with an Online Ambassador And I kept being told every time I asked that it was being handled by the Steering Committee There was zero transparency and I even had a post removed and got very bad vibs for asking questions from some of editors I don t know what if any positions they held in the Education Program So I am very surprised and relieved to read above The Steering Committee in its most recent form wasn t responsible for overseeing anything except the online ambassador management and recruitment as a result the current status of online ambassador recruitment and management is largely unknown So I welcome Pine s transparency and your acknowledgment from my point of view of reality and I hope that this all works out I know that some editors keep lists of course articles in their sandbox with the goal of fixing them all up So there still is a reservoir of good will among some community editors to protect wikipedia from these students I m posting here with the best of intentions and not to harm anyone Best wishes 23 50 2,0.01813338,0.0034426015,0.0028022912,0.00059208286,0.0013948028

0,If you re interested in the Administration position with respect to this here s the excerpt from the DOJ white paper Even if there were ambiguity about whether FISA read together with the AUMF permits the President to authorize the NSA activities the canon of constitutional avoidance requires reading these statutes in harmony to overcome any restrictions in FISA and Title III at least as they might otherwise apply to the congressionally authorized armed conflict with al Qaeda Indeed were FISA and Title III interpreted to impede the President s ability to use the traditional tool of electronic surveillance to detect and prevent future attacks by a declared enemy that has already struck at the homeland and is engaged in ongoing operations against the United States the constitutionality of FISA as applied to that situation would be called into very serious doubt In fact if this difficult constitutional question had to be addressed FISA would be unconstitutional as applied to this narrow context Importantly the FISA Court of Review itself recognized just three years ago that the President retains constitutional authority to conduct foreign surveillance apart from the FISA framework and the President is certainly entitled at a minimum to rely on that judicial interpretation of the Constitution and FISA,0.02234184,0.031151842,0.0023103359,0.0005739215,0.0013987495

0,Abuse Hello I was recently banned and then rebanned for a fortnight and then banned from contacting others or even writing on my own talk page I feel that serious abuses have occurred and my account clearly shows who was abusing their tools The final block of me being able to even write on my own talk page about how I was blocked unjustly and the inherent problems that I could spot in the process really took the cake and I think that moderator named Tarc but the others too need to be seriously reprimanded and even stripped of their tools because this was serious abuse of power and it was taken to an excessive level that shows clear abuse I think Can you please advise me on what to do to follow up on this because I believe this is of the highest importance to wikipedia integrity Thank you JohnHistory,0.72458905,0.0106289275,0.010480435,0.0005917005,0.0028608432

0,Request for comment Wikipedia article on Pottery This dispute is concerned with definitions of the term pottery and the way that differing definitions of the term should affect the content of the Pottery article The term pottery is defined narrowly by some reputable authorities to exclude everything but pottery vessels pots dishes and suchlike things Other equally reputable authorities define the term more widely to include such things as figurines statuettes and tiles The question of when and where the first pottery was made is a highly contentious one in some quarters Attempts have been made on one side to prove that the earliest pottery is that represented by ceramic figurines found in the modern day Czech Republic while others have sought to prove that the earliest pottery is that represented by ceramic vessels found in modern day Japan A protagonist in the dispute holds the firm opinion that only vessels can be pottery and from this argues that the pottery article must present without qualification the view that the Japanese vessels are the world s earliest pottery Another protagonist in the dispute holds the view that the wider definitions of the term pottery should be taken into account and that mention of the Czech figurines should not be excluded from the article This matter has been discussed since February of last year under many headings on this page and at User talk Brunnock,0.024080997,0.016119791,0.0041890116,0.0005684136,0.0016107032

0,thank you for your input this is exactly what the article needed The parts of the article that are being removed are not significant parts and rather are blatant negative attacks While i agree that lying to prospective students is not correct why must negative parts be highlighted Keep the facts and i use this word lightly with this group positive and help the school advance and produce better and more qualified physicians Prospective students can always call up their own state board or the school s offices and ask questions If anyone has proof that the CURRENT administration or school officials are lying to students prospective or current about possible licensure issue or charter issues or anything for that matter then yes the school should have something formally brought against them From what i see the school has been and is currently being investigated by the GMC Should the GMC find problems that are beyond repair then the school will be closed and then no need to bash anymore because the school will fade away Portraying the situation as constantly negative helps no one at all Help correct the problem instead of being a problem I m looking at 2 of you and you know who you are and portray the positive side of things that several students despite this situation have gone on to be very successful thank you again for impartial imput 3 August 2006 UTC,0.13033749,0.007260327,0.00084287045,0.00057331356,0.0014156713

0,Proposing renaming and new article draft Over the last couple of months I have produced a new draft of this article working on behalf of New Leaders The organization asked me to write an updated draft better reflecting their new name and current programs and bringing the article into line with Wikipedia s guidelines The most immediate issue with the current article is that the title is now incorrect The organization has recently been renamed to New Leaders and is now no longer New Leaders for New Schools Due to this change I believe that the article should be renamed I recognize that since I prepared my draft on behalf of New Leaders I have a conflict of interest So before I make any changes I d like to ask that other editors read through my draft and my explanation here and offer any feedback they might have There are a number of problems with the current article not least that it is rather promotional in tone It seems that this has attracted the attention of editors in the past as you can see from the warning tag However despite the warning tag and the discussion that was opened by NDSteve10 on the Talk page see above there hasn t really been any improvement to the article in the last 12 months No editors responded to the Talk page note and only a few edits have been made In fact little has changed with the article since it was originally created in December 2009 The article currently has few citations less than half of which are reliable secondary sources The introduction doesn t adequately summarize the article and certainly does not give a real sense of what New Leaders does The most problematic sections are What it does and Educational impact both of which are written in a promotional tone especially the latter In addition the What it does section is outdated since the organization has since introduced new programs and initiatives Meanwhile the Educational impact section provides a lot of detail but would be better presented using Wikipedia s summary style The information provided is cited to New Leaders website but makes no mention that the source of the claims is the organization itself I would like to propose a new draft of the article that addresses the issues with the current version which you can view in my userspace User 16912 Rhiannon New Leaders This is an entirely re written article using reliable secondary sources as much as possible with new section headings to provide readers with a sense of the content at a glance a new introduction which properly summarizes the article and an infobox with all the key information about the organization fully up to date The Creation and history section now includes details of the organization s founding and expansion up to the present day The descriptive information about New Leaders has been removed as this is more relevant in the new Function section The information from the current What it does and Educational impact sections has been rewritten under a new section heading of Function which includes the organization s mission its programs and its results This section provides details of all the organization s current initiatives and an overview of the impact of these programs I have retained the sections on Geographic reach and Executive team but updated the information in each and added citations While I have put much effort into writing this from a neutral POV I appreciate that due to my COI it may be that other editors have some changes to suggest I welcome any productive feedback on the draft and my suggestion to rename the article to New Leaders Please let me know if you have any thoughts or questions Thanks,0.0065170475,0.0030169268,0.0027981026,0.0005694743,0.0012905925

0,No need to apologize My editorial comments are sometimes more curt or critical than they should be and this quite naturally elicits a strong reaction The problem of ground pressure was well understood by the US Army Ordnance Dept during WWII I find it difficult to identify any direct relationship between the T 34 s lower ground pressure and efforts by the US Army Ordnance Dept to achieve similar results In fact designers of both tanks were simply reacting to the conditions imposed by the European battlefield and the Russian s worked out the solution while the American s were still getting the M4 ready for battle in the sands of N Africa Keep in mind that the relatively few engagements involving T 34s and M4s were fought mostly at relatively close ranges This helped mask the penetration problems of the 76mm HVAP It was only marginally better than the AP shot round and led to a generalized misunderstanding of the tank s effectiveness against its Russian counterpart I have not heard of a 90mm Sherman seeing combat in Korea In answer to your question about who was responsible for sending us out in undergunned death traps it was Lt Gen Leslie J McNair A long time staffer McNair was a genius at organization but demonstrated very little understanding of or for that matter any willingness to learn about the actual effectiveness of our tanks and tank destroyers on the battlefield Had he died a year earlier we would have gone ashore in Europe equipped with 250 T26 tanks and possibly even some 90mm Shermans It would have made a difference,0.0067626275,0.0057115643,0.0013086393,0.0006152985,0.0016299923

0,Okay Thanks for the comments and the reminder about reliable sources Also thanks for revising the sources on Garner s page I think even with the sources the Cherokee page editors will probably remove his name as well as Kristin Chenoweth s Apparently they only want people who are members of the Cherokee Nation It is too bad because both Mr Garner and Ms Chenoweth are proud of their heritage and aren t using it to gain more fame Mr Garner in fact is involved in many causes to publicize the history and the needs of the Cherokee people Neither are Johnny Depp Kevin Costner and several others using their ancestry to bring attention to themselves There are those who fake their ancestry to get attention but none of the people I named people have a reason to do so Also there are people of Cherokee ancestry who for whatever reason cannot join the Cherokee Nation especially those like Chenoweth who were adopted and may not have the paperwork showing her lineage Anyways I ll get off my soapbox now Thanks again for your sharp eyes,0.1241823,0.016161779,0.00047864323,0.00057925575,0.0013809102

0,Nazirim A revision was made after someone added information about Nazerites with a question in the comments of the edits Potentially one could take the vow of becoming a Nazir upon themselves but could not be released from the vow so it would potentially be in effect the rest of their lives rather than a month Then their child I guess could be a Nazerite child Because no 3yo that I know of would really be born a Nazerite Nazirim today are out of the scope of this article Even Nazirim in the 16th century I d think would be out of the scope as well The article is not on Jews and Hair but solely on the ceremony of upsherin The same text might be valuable somewhere else but not here,0.025045425,0.029917702,0.00086512417,0.0005924391,0.0018388473

0,Friedmans words are clearly quoted and clearly cited via the article linked to A source you have removed for some reason Do you have something to contribute from Blitzers side Please by all means include it Is lack of something from Blitzers side a reason to exclude citicism and delete a large chunk of the article I dont think so Unless you can actually defend your changes citing policy you will need to revert them To clarify yes Near East Report is an AIPAC publication as I said four days ago Whether it was published by AIPAC in the 70s I don t know although it is likely What we do know is that Blitzer started working for the JPost in 1973 He may very well have edited a version of Myths Facts in 1976 by the way en edition of that book was published every two years Plenty of journalists do outside work Keep in mind that we are an encyclopedia You need a reliable source thats says who he worked for and the dates Pulling this information together from different primary sources is original research You cannot quote somebody as calling Near East Report a propaganda sheet any more than another editor can say Belfast is inhabited by drunken and violent Irish people with the quote cited to Thomas Nast You also can t cite three people attacking Blitzer s scholarship in Territory of Lies without any response from Blitzer or his supporters Firstly I wont respond to your silly example referring to where I live Your racism is disgusting and reflects only on you but thats your problem Secondly please dont further insult the intelligence of editors by implying that Near East Report was possibly published by someone else in 1970s Blitzer edited the book ergo he worked for AIPAC likewise he was editor of the weekly publication Near East Report into 1978 Source The directoy listing showing his name listed as the responsible party at the weekly He worked for them in 1976 77 78 regardless of whether you seek to portray that as outside work or anything else His name is on the front cover of the book as editor right His name is listed in the weekly publication as editor right Are those facts in dispute by you Friedmans words are his own you removed not only the quote whos inclusion you disagree with but all the other details Fine remove the quote but removing everything else Criticism of Blitzer does belong in the section detailing criticism An automatic rebuttal isnt necessarily required if its a minority view and or it cant be located I looked for Blitzers rebuttal did you Please include inline or in its own responses to criticism section but please stop acting unilaterally and work towards a consensus,0.070357345,0.07976616,0.0015281497,0.0005998551,0.003999144

0,Mathematicians hired to monitor transactions I removed the following part of the article Business dk reported that the bank has a team of mathematicians employed to surveil the clients trading patterns Saxo Bank is not doing anything untraditional in employing mathematicians since indeed most larger financial institutions employ a number of mathematicians economists and even physicists To a lay reader this may sound incriminating or disturbing but the main task of these employees is in fact to improve the trading systems performance in relation to speed and pricing and safety in relation to sniping and other unauthorized activity Furthermore the secret source in the business dk article referenced claims that Saxo employs these mathematicians to monitor individual trading patterns in order to take unfair advantage of customers However and this is not stated in the business dk article Saxo shows the same two sided price for the same amount at the same time to any and all clients trading This means that no single clients trading pattern is of interest Therefore the accusation in the business dk article is not only wrong but also shows the lack of insight from the secret source and the journalist who wrote it The fact that an article was brought in an online newspaper does not excuse wrong information In relation to this particular statement regarding the role of the employed mathematicians therefore the article is in my opinion an unreliable source in accordance with the Wikipedia principles of WP IRS Either this information regarding the widespread use of mathematicians among larger financial institutions and regarding Saxo showing the two sided price etc should be included which I originally did until it was removed to clarify to the lay reader that this is not uncommon or suspicious and correct the mistaken information in the business dk article or the information about employing mathematicians should be left out completely to preserve the neutrality of the article,0.04673292,0.0931186,0.011560416,0.00057484617,0.0014433558

0,Lone boatman it is you who have willfully and repeatedly violated Wikipedia s policies by making entire changes to the eternity clause article then threatening me as usual And you ask me now to stay cool as you continue to manipulate editors and possible administrators to cover your wrongdoings Oh I am staying cool You know full and well that I am staying cool If I was not cool I would have deleted your last changes It is you who made the last changes not me Hopefully administrators will see through your manipulations and make the right decisions Clearly you wanted a concensus and several other editors suddenly turned up for te first time What a coincidence You are not aiming at a concensus but are vandalizing sabotaging the eternity clause article JanetteDoe You are right that the referenced article in National Review is about not changing the fundamental principles of democracy not a constitution And this is why I have a BIG problem with Lone boatman and the three other editors who suddenly showed up for the first timee and agreed with Lone boatman Lone boatman does not want the word democracy After I accused him of synthesizing he then took revenge by changing the entire article into a catch all international page in which he redefines eternity clause as a term used internationally instead of the colloquial description specific to Article 79 paragraph 3 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany This page was part of the German law page specific to Germany not an international one which is already covered under a Wikipedia article entitled entrenched clause Lone boatman added the additional international data at the top of the page only to cover up the eternity clause article And again he focused on the word constitution at the top of his change And when I told him he had wrongfully duplicated the entrenched clause to pursue his use of the word constitution which I had previously told him Germany does not have he then added Basic Law to his change to make it appear that he is not politically motivated with his changes Then several editors suddently showed up for the first time and one of them deleted the entire eternity clause article leaving only what Lone boatman had put in at the top Wikipedia is apparently no place to safeguard an article even a properly referenced article which the article was And it was not a personal essay on a statute as I have been accused of It is an important historic prohibition placed in the Germany s Basic Law regarding the protection of Germany s new democracy,0.33561873,0.02898651,0.0060203257,0.0006285285,0.0026509294

0,The argument from majority Fine this is Wikipedia and not primary literature so the argument from majority is not automatically considered a logical fallacy OK But how many people have rejected the DC hypothesis for reasons other than bah yet another long range proposal Again the fact that the Proto Caucasian and Proto Sino Tibetan reconstructions used are difficult to test is in the article you re welcome to move it to a more prominent position Sure Trask has mainly because his reconstruction of Pre Basque is different I will mention this more prominently in the article But besides Here is a post by Stefan Georg on when a hypothesis on language relationships should be considered accepted For the record Georg is currently most famous for fighting against the Altaic hypothesis though he accepts a Tungusic Korean Japonic grouping as likely rejects Nostratic rejects DC but accepts Seefloth s Uralo Siberian because it s based on morphology Here is a follow up by Trask here one by Vovin and here another one by Georg To be an Indo Europeanist you have to know a lot about each of the branches of IE How many people other than the late Starostin have anything near that kind of knowledge about East Caucasian and West Caucasian and Yeniseian and Sino Tibetan and so on Bengtson seems to be working on it but he almost completely limits himself to Basque the two Caucasians and Burushaski which he finds to be closely related but he almost never mentions Sino Tibetan or Na Den That makes about one half of a person that is capable of judging the DC hypothesis as a whole beyond finding mistakes in the data from one of the supposed members For that matter Starostin himself largely ignored Na Den Basque and Burushaski Is there already a paper that takes the proposed evidence apart If so I ll be glad to cite it For the record here is a discussion of a paper that shows IMHO quite clearly that what little evidence there was for including Omotic in Afro Asiatic was wrong A link to that paper is included Here incidentally is an introduction to Burushaski secondary literature which makes favorable comparisons to Yeniseian and Sino Tibetan In sum I don t see anything wrong with presenting the hypothesis in its latest incarnation on Wikipedia It is a controversial discussion subject so comparatively many people will find it interesting In the meantime I ll add some morphological evidence suppletive pronoun paradigms noun class prefixes to the Macro Caucasian section of the article provided that Bengtson tells me that this paper is actually published I ll also try to make more mention of the hypotheses that combine Sino Tibetan with geographically adjacent families and thus contradict DC,0.15236588,0.0062723625,0.003603235,0.00056811306,0.0015839956

0,Episodes I see this a lot when you edit but with half hour tv shows but hour long episodes are counted as two not one I would say you wouldn t have to put those in but the episode list has a section for the production code so normally most shows iCarly How to Rock Jessie etc if it s an hour long episode for season one the code will be 111 112 because it counts as two and since the wikipedia asks for a production code I think it s needed Since itunes does not show production code order rather just list the episodes as their shown on TV that do not include that This is why I strongly feel that shows like Victorious episode Freak the Freak Out and others should be listed as two and not one It was an hour long episode after all and if you go back and check how many episodes Nickelodeon ordered for the first season of Victorious it says 20 which was also confirmed by the shows creator Dan Schneider I strongly disagree that it should say 19 along with other shows that have been edited,0.0068655396,0.1350559,0.00048593455,0.000577155,0.0017798668

0,the 40 000 protesters myth I understand that some members have a politically motivated desire to make the 2010 election look as sinister and anti democratic as possible but you have to get the facts straight about these four sources on 40 000 protesters 1 This one shouldn t be considered altogether It is a UNHCR page quoting instead of a reliable news source a Washington based foundation whose purpose is to inform and educate policy makers and the broader policy community about events and trends in those societies which are strategically or tactically important to the United States and which frequently restrict access to such information It is a politically biased organization not an independent news source So out with it 2 These two are respectively the Voice of America and MSNBC not MSNBC really but a direct quote from Bloomberg here So in reality it is VoA and Bloomberg Well let me inform you that we are talking about the same guy his name is James Brooke as anyone can plainly see since 2006 he has been stationed in Moscow to report for Bloomberg and as of last summer for the VoA as well Leaving aside the fact that the VoA is more of a propaganda tool fully owned by US government rather than an independent news source let s see how Mr Brooke came about this magic number 40 000 Apparently he was there but did he count the demonstrators himself No he quotes Associated Press Within an hour the Associated Press was estimating the turnout at 40 000 Well it wasn t Anyone can see the number of AP and that number is 10 000 A little white lie Mr Brooke Or maybe I m too harsh maybe AP did broadcast that number intially but then seeing how preposterous it was quickly brought it down to what all the other major media guys were reporting In any event this 40 000 people thing doesn t hold water 3 Basically the same goes for CBC as well As I already said in one of the comments not only CBC didn t have its own staff in Minsk that night I checked this myself here in Toronto with CBC Headquarters anyone can see how heavily in that article it relied on other media Reuters reported The Associated Press reported As we know already from these quotes both Reuters and Associated Press mentioned 10 000 protesters each Given all the above I m removing the 40 000 people part from the article,0.5781449,0.025449451,0.003421852,0.0010283294,0.0014912752

0,Lol you know what i meant Whichever president came before Hafez i just new he was president before assad has considerable foreground of support in which his supports would have freaked out because of the coup They would have claimed instability would arise as assad s supporters are trying to use in their defense What i am trying to say is that although Bashar assad had good economic and international policies for Syria you should not fear a non baathist potentially being elected Syria s economic and international policies won t change iran would still be a major factor in Syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges the only this that would change are social freedoms and for the better Also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today The Muslim brotherhood in Syria is weak even weaker than the islamist prescence in Libya The rebels in Libya had 80 90 support as we see now and yet could hardly take control without NATO What chance does the Syrian Muslim brotherhood have None If anything nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians As you know I am pro Syria and Armenia just not pro Assad Unlike Armenia where people like Sargsyan and Kopcharyan were democratically elected Assad was not no one ran against him because they were not allowed,0.036138166,0.011359,0.0049782437,0.00070586125,0.0020902876

0,NOEDITSECTION NOTOC Archive 23 Archive 24 Archive 25 United Wrestling Association Thank you very much for your time effort cleaning up United Wrestling Association It looks wonderful now I appreciate that very much Triple Crown and Grand Slam Champions I am not and was never looking to start trouble all I am trying to do is expand a definition based on fact and references The Triple Crown and the Grand Slam are what we have been going back and forth on My contention is that The Intercontinental and United States Championships are equal and thus are interchangeable when when deciding a Crown Slam You say no because WWE never explicitly came out and said so On 8 4 06 JBL said he was a Slam winner A WWE wrestler on WWE TV said he accomplished a WWE sanctioned feat It was said that no outside source has verified this but no one in WWE has disputed JBL s claim either Also it must be pointed out that PWI has always considered the two championships as equal When PWI used to do their rankings for WWF and WCW the I C and U S Titles were always listed as automatic number one contenders for their respective World Champions The same holds true today when they do the rankings for Raw I C and Smackdown U S PWI is considered the main source for what is considered a World Title and their word is law here on Wikipedia They also have always maintained that the I C and U S Championships are of equal value and of equal standing As I have said before I am not trying to vandalize or add nonsense to Wikipedia only enhance it with an updated definition based on consensus and fact based on logic and references JBL PWI and many other wiki users have backed up this definition Look at the Triple Crown Champion Discussion page All I ask is my contribution be allowed to stand as I respectfully feel that I am in the right on this one Thank you for your time Vlh The preceding unsigned comment was added by talk contribs Re Sprotected3 The merge idea sounds good Thanks Reply It works fine Thanks again Reply per cscwem Hi Moe I m particularly sensitive about people asking me about the reasons for my votes So I won t be offended if you are or decline to answer heck I walk that line frequently It is my hope though that our past history will put aside the notion that I m grilling you over the coals I found your vote opposing CSCWEM today I was wondering if you could explain to me what I ve missed I personally voted against him for administratorship on the basis that he simply did not need it to continue the work he was doing He still doesn t And frankly I oppose most RFAs In this case though I ve interacted with him a lot and find him to be I hate to use the term a real standup kind of guy If you d deign to explain to me I d be most grateful Thanks Alex aa talk You know I mostly agree with everything you ve said I think the one perception difference we have is that I see him interacting with a lot of users in the process of all those revert edits But your point is valid Thanks for letting me know aa talk 22 19,0.017758235,0.32115838,0.0019049176,0.00070114835,0.0032536306

0,Minotaurgirl Kelly knew what color her eyes were when she made the song Behind These Hazel Eyes Comparing the pictures of Kelly and Belle they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it Belle s eyes are little lighter Someone made a video called Behind Belle s Hazel Eyes the person who made this video knew what color Belle s eyes were and decided to include Belle s name in the title And if you read the comments the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like green or hazel they look more hazel than brown or green yup belles eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved I like the problem solved part With Minotaurgirl s bias against the idea of Belle having hazel eyes I think there will always be a problem with people like her involved TV Tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her so much so they forbade users from writting what Belle s eye color is Notice how Belle s name is missing from the Eye Color tropes colony while the rest of Disney Princesses have their eye color mentioned Belle s name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki This is Minotaurgirl s account as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite the reason inserting false information the false information being writting down Belle s eyes as brown And now here s Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia Is there any repsite from her I noticed she has a Live Journal account See what she has written The lack of links speaks for itself She thinks she actually proved Belle s eyes are brown depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie like the screenshots she send me By magnifying the images you can see her eyes are hazel colored and not the same color as her hair at all Notice how she s afriad to use close ups of Belle s eye cuz she knows they ll appear hazel if she did so thus disproving her On her blog she didn t mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle s eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn t She wrote Bleh Kids these days This one needs a hobby I m tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot s damage and I m fairly sure the mods of these sites are too Would it be possible to just block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners Yup she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said believes If anyone deserves to be blocked it s Minotaurgirl If it wasn t for her bias sites like like TV Tropes Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn t have suffered an edit war about Belle s eye color The fact that there was never an edit about Belle s eye color until Minotaurgirl came along says a lot Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago no edit war about Belle s eye color happened there either It s like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle s eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown just cuz she likes to think so not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented It s like someone going around changing Ariel s eyes from blue to green just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green eyed Thinks don t work like that My overall opinion on Minotaurgurl I think it s safe to say the interent is better off without her She s toxic she s a nuisance she s talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her she lies she mangles twists and misrepresents other people s words and she causes edit wars Action needs to be taken against people like this,0.005348266,0.34223095,0.0028775448,0.0014650074,0.0025335625

0,Which works are these exactly Andrew Previously you were claiming her method book was published by Mel Bay which I corrected to self published like the majority of her books CDs So what exactly has Mel Bay published of Marlow Which some works for ten string guitar As far as Mel Bay s catalogue is concerned Marlow has one little piece Of the Sea in an anthology not edited by her and not for 10 string guitar ISBN 0786674563 and some arrangements for flute and SIX string guitar of easy light classics ISBN 078664687X This is hardly anything to base a claim on of someone being an authority on the TEN string guitar Also anyone with musical knowledge can compare the quality of my own editions on my site and those by Janet Marlow and see who is the authority Anyway I have the support of Fritz Buss who studied with Yepes between 1960 and 1986 and whom Yepes considered an excellent guitarist with a wonderful technique but also a deep musician aware of his responsibility and always in search of more knowledge and perfection as well as considering Buss one of the three best guitar teachers in the word And Fritz Buss has written that Viktor van Niekerk is a conscious artist with a total understanding of the ten string guitar as envisioned by Narciso Yepes And I have the autographed documents to prove it So Andrew if you have something constructive some actual knowledge to contibute then please do so But this is nothing more than a personal vendetta against me for speaking out against individuals who have been publishing misinformation,0.0026223029,0.014912428,0.0021231137,0.0005714606,0.0012965013

0,Thanks for your comments You asked Why single out RCOG That would be because the present article is about RCOG You asked would you described these as pro choice advocacy groups Please observe that my edit to this article said that RCOG took a pro choice position about a particular issue That is different from saying that RCOG is a pro choice advocacy group KillerChihuahua pointed out that difference here I am not trying to avoid your question about the BMA though it s not relevant in connection with the present article Yes I would personally view the BMA as a pro choice advocacy group After all the report to which you refer states that the BMA does not start off from a neutral position in this debate the BMA has repeatedly since the 1970s agreed sic policy statements supporting the Abortion Act and calling for the legislation to be extended to Northern Ireland I admit that it is hypothetically possible that opposition to reducing abortion time limits might be motivated by concerns about late diagnosis of fetal abnormalities As you know such abortions account for a very tiny fractions of abortions but you re correct that concern about such situations could hypothetically cause someone to block a general reduction in time limits However RCOG has said it is pro choice explicitly supporting rights of women to exercise personal choice RCOG has not only opposed reductions in abortion time limits but has also sought to make abortions easier and faster It therefore would seem very odd to contend that RCOG has never taken any pro choice positions,0.08573227,0.038378123,0.0018943362,0.00059328583,0.001706277

0,Social Justice article Hi please see me response to your changes on the Talk Social justice page Cheers replied on Talk Social justice Regarding taking to RFD You know I m not really sure I don t imagine there would be a problem just removing all the text from AFD and listing at WP RFD However the afd2 page would need to be deleted by a sysop A tag on that page with an edit summary not too different from Afd listing page created by me in error redirect will now be listed at WP RFD should do the trick Oh and sorry for not responding for many hours I was at work that damn making a living malarkey sometimes gets in the way of editing Wikipedia Done Thanks for your help and don t worry about taking a little while to get back This working from home malarky has the advantage that I can play with WP all the time It also has the disadvantage that I can play with WP all the time and never get any work done Cheers Leading paragraphs for articles Hi SamClark this is just a comment that was made to me that I thought I would pass onto you for you to think about and respond how you please The leading paragrpahs in Global Justice and your draft at User Sam Clark justice read like the introduction to an essay Particularly the last sentences which say what the article will discuss This is what I did when I created a few articles from scratch mainly because the only type of writing I ever do is for essays But a couple of people have commented that as an encyclopaedic article the first section is more like a synopsis rather than an introduction and would generally just sum up the points of the rest of the article For instance instead of It considers the various ways in which justice has been understood distinguishes two broad kinds of justice and then describes several theories of justice under each of those two headings It could say something like There are various ways to understand justice but generally you ca distinguish between two kinds of justice distributive justice and retributive justice Distributive justice is concerned with the proper distribution of good things while Retributive justice is concerned with the proper response to wrongdoing And then it would just go straight into the article If you look at most of the long standing and comprehensive articles that seems to be the way they are written Cheers Heh good point In my case it s being in the habit of writing lecture notes but the same point applies I ll change Thanks Rewrite of Justice I think it would be great to see the derivation of the word justice from the latin not the french etc and perhaps a section on history on how our understanding of the term has evolved ie what it meant in different times and different places Justice is defintely a philosophical concept and so it is important to discuss the philosophical meanings and debates concerning justice but it is also a political judicial term as well as an everday term that people use and so it would be good to have all of this represented in the article eventually I think stuff like this from the original article is very important In most cases what one regards as just not necessarily meaning what is just is determined by consulting established and agreeable principles employing logic or natural law In specific systems justice is determined by consulting a majority or in social contexts where religion dominates justice may be thought to require deference to religious texts or to spiritual guidance under a monarchy or authoritarian state the ruler s determined what was just and doled out justice All of these determinants of justice have at times delivered particularlly dark periods of history where justice was seen to be absent If a person lives under a specific set of laws in a country concepts of justice are often simply deferential to the existing law the issuing of punitive reprimands for violations may be referred to as serving justice In principle this fits the general concept in that the individuals get what is supposedly due to them Justice however is a universal and absolute concept laws principles religion etc are merely attempts to codify the concept occasionally with results that entirely contradict the true nature of justice Also this paragraph In some cases justice is not e,0.046353538,0.10869141,0.00057852524,0.0005816283,0.0013578559

0,Yes you are correct I do beleive that the Arbitration process in Wikipedia is crap The vast majority of cases these days are just one editor or a group of editors trying to force their way on others It is no longer about doing the right thing for the project Regarding helping out at AE I do wholeheartedly agree it would be good for more admins to get involved and that is true of many areas of WP not just AE Part of the problem is that most admins are given the toolset because they keep their heads down and do not get involved in these areas Those that do much like myself are too untrustworthy or lack the proper temperment to be admins So its a never ending self perpetuating cycle of promoting the sheep to guard against the wolf Also more than one editor and admin alike has voiced that they feel that you don t listen to comments at AE and largely do what you want so why would they help out,0.045363896,0.09074945,0.0009391915,0.00058034394,0.0012848274

0,Elelland Hello Humus I am sorry if I have placed this note in the wrong spot I m very inexperienced with Wikipedia I was enthralled by Wikipedia Initially That is until I met Eleland I noticed that you had some interesting discussions with Eleland Eleland engineered a small article which I contributed some information to be deleted He organised a kangaroo court made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus The Article was on Ed O Loughlin Fairfax publishing MidEast correspondent The said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary He was amongst the candidates for this year s HR com dishonest reporter award despite being in the Australia only catchment area so you can imagine the quality of his journalism Anyway Eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted So I studied Eleland a little I ve looked at over 100 of his posts on the Arab Israel conflict More than 95 were directly anti Israel His modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the pro Israel side In this way he has undermined many many articles Personally I don t care what his opinion is but when he uses his editorial power and influence at Wikipedia to falsely invalidate delete manipulate etc I think there is a problem Wikipedia is I am afraid beginning to read like Eleland wrote the script Who is Eleland What power does he actually have Can anything be done Adon Emmet If you post a reply here I will contact here or even by e mail,0.63399345,0.011964253,0.002017912,0.0005842987,0.0022589455

0,You are correct that I removed that reference which I myself added before This was however because it was no longer needed in the Fatherland party article seeing that I have now created a separate article for the international organisation in question where all information is provided A reference in the former article is therefore now superflous and unnecessary,0.011078689,0.013757116,0.00050422584,0.0005828392,0.0012064035

0,Wii Thank you for your updates to the Wii article However I must point out a few things As referenced here 480p 720x480 and 640x480 are both 480p the difference lies in what ratio a set or program is displayed in 4 3 or 16 9 not what resolution 480p 720p and 1080p all refer to the vertical resolution not the horizontal The Wii mote s input is entirely different than the PS3 controller The PS3 controller s technology has been utilized in PC controllers for well over 10 years the only difference is that the PS3 s is apparently supposed to sense forward and backwards movement The Wii mote s nunhuck add on has the same functions but the remote itself has pixel perfect pointing the PS3 controller does not As for Wii wee that has no place in the article itself as it only furthers the problem The article references toilet humor and that should suffice for informing anyone new to the name that it may conjure up other meanings,0.0037874486,0.04247758,0.00018161298,0.0005740065,0.0013320926

0,It s really rather sad That I can ask an otherwise legitimate question on a talk page like this but because one person does not like the way I phrased it it is suddenly vandalism and deleted completely If anything you could say I was rude in the way I asked my question but as far as I can tell vandalism intentionally disruptive edits and more importantly edits to actual articles These talk pages are intended to talk are they not The standards of writing something in an encyclopedic manner do not apply here At least from my understanding But even if they do assuming that my post was solely created as a vandalism when I was asking an otherwise legitimate question is completely unnecessary Or are those policies such as WP Assume Good Faith or whatever all for show after all Seems very seldom that people actually do assume good faith around here They re just as happy to tag anything they don t like as vandalism even more so if the person posting it isn t a regular I dunno just a few observations I ll admit that I don t edit here often so if I ve somehow missed something that somehow changes the situation completely feel free to let me know 98 208 65 56,0.031630956,0.08190331,0.0006951046,0.0005797473,0.0014661246

0,Your comment in the Serbian Americans talk page I was checking that talk page to see if anyone had maybe listed new data to a question I had posed a few months ago and I saw your comment there I thought it was interesting I ve never before seen someone else write about an American ethnicity the same way I have thought about it I know that the Southeast has the greatest number of people declaring their ethnicity as American but I think this ethnic label would apply to the majority of racially White Americans and not just those in the Southeast The Americans outside of the South that descended from pre 20 c immigrants from the UK Ireland and Germany seem to have substantially meshed together into a White ethnic group not just racially but ethnically as well The only cultural differences between ethnic Whites of the North where 19c immigrants mostly settled and those of the South is that the South still experiences religion and social conservatism as very influential forces on daily life Where for the more recent ethnic Whites this is not the case e g in the North So the distinctive cultural aspects of the South have not been adopted by the ethnic Whites of the North even with several centuries having passed I do not want to make false generalizations however this is my sense of the average situation in those regions based on my travels and time spent living here The areas where distinct ethnic identity has been conserved is in the major cities The city centred ethnic groups in the US have preserved a substantial part of their culture in absence of preserving their language for the most part A few well known examples would be the Irish and Italian Americans of the Northeast So long as their numbers are high enough to have a large enough community cultural traditions endure What I am getting at is that so long as a Ukrainian American stays in a major city s he has no reason to be forced into completely adopting a new ethnicity S he won t have to abandon the culture of his her community If s he were to move to an area in the Southeast then it would be a completely different story I d like to give you a further illustration the Poles of Chicago Most arrived somewhere between the 1850s and 1940s or so Many have had families there for well over a century There has been very limited migration out of Chicagoland for this period and the Polish community there has remained extremely strong So there is not much past observation that would suggest that cities are only an entry point from which ethnic communities later break down as they go their own ways I ve written all of this to demonstrate how the ethnic Americans and people who ethnically not racially but ethnically identify as White are distinct ethnically from the more recent post 1850 European ethnic communities in the major cities I find it all very interesting The only problem that sometimes arises is when individuals do not make the distinction between an Ameican US citizen and an ethnic American and in so doing sometimes end up labeling certain individuals as being un American These people that do not make the distinction show frustration when a person does not abandon his her culture and adopt their own This is of course on an individual by individual basis and I would not generalize this in any way to any region or sub region I ve seen ethnic hostilities projected towards myself or family friends from people of all sorts of backgrounds I ve seen it demonstrated by Southerners New Yorkers and even Jews in South Florida By the way most of the time my ethnicity and that of family friends would have been indeterminable by those people I m saying this because I don t want to suggest that any particular regional group of Americans is more racist discriminant than another region I ve spent a lot of time in South Florida and the racist attitudes that come from some of the people there have been really surprising at times especially when you take into account that many of those racists that I have come across would themselves been the target of racism less than 50 years ago Its all unfortunate and these types of racist discriminatory and nationalistic attitudes are probably present in most countries The good part about our differences is that ethnic Americans and newer Americans have no trouble in cooperating with one another when it comes to maximizing profit This is not the case in say many areas of the former Yugoslavia or in the areas where ex Yugoslavs have settled throughout the Western world Sorry for the lack of brevity Your comment was interesting and I wanted to expand on it Also I want you to know that none of the above is meant to be offensive towards any group or the US or the US as a whole Usually when I do,0.82103693,0.18252198,0.0009834062,0.0006890104,0.0020143497

0,Talk Ramon Berenguer III Count of Barcelona Talk Ramon Berenguer III Count of Barcelona might interest you Peter III of Aragon What is your rationale for preferring the late portrait of Peter over a contemporary coin Your edits are predominantly changes to lead images yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them You also reverted my change without even knowing what contemporary means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not The reasons to prefer the coin are it is a contemporary artefact giving information about Peter s reign w a caption and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetime the coin does not mislead readers about the times of Peter III as the portrait might the silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat garish portrait in low resolution JPG format it is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate clean shaven and long haired than the greater detail of the imaginary portrait the later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later it gives us no information about Peter or his reign its sole purpose was decorative what makes the coin an image of Peter is that that is when it was struck and what for but what makes the later portrait an image of Peter is that somebody labelled it that way they could just as easily have labelled an image of any other Aragonese king In your last edit summary you ask if I have to choose between two unreal representations I prefer the portrait but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer Srnec the problem is that we have different criteria You think the images should provide information about the lives of the persons and be of the age in which these people lived I think the only thing to do is to give a visual representation of the person the article is to the information I think that a portrait even if wasn t painted during the live of the person is most valid that a little image carved in a coin The two representations have the same chance of not being 100 accurate but at least one illustrates better than the other If not exist any portrait of this person then I accept a coin s image or a poor drawing But the present picture accomplish the role and I think that it must be more time I already argued why the coin is a better illustration and you ve just asserted the contrary Do you have an argument Why are your criteria better than mine Really When I rebutted all your arguments in your talk page I stated my reasons But I do not want another long discussion with you I offer consensus Would you take a picture of the first part of the thirteenth century Both of those are improvements over the 17th century image but not over the coin At least one other editor agrees with me Sorry I m not agree with your second comment but I hope we have made a step in the right direction This discussion is already too long Both images are the best ones that meet your rigid standard of closeness to the character s life Either both seem right Imposing your personal preference is not how it occurs on Wikipedia I noticed in the message above that this is not the first time that you try to impose pictures on articles regardless of what others think You are not allowed to impose your will Both Pedro I of Brazil and Pedro II of Brazil are Featured Articles They were reviewed by several editors Stop with your edit warring Lecen is aware of the three revert rule Are you You ve reverted four times on both Pedro I and Pedro II in the last 24 hours You should undo your last revert and seek dispute resolution such as discussion on the talk page or a request for comment,0.00896405,0.004697077,0.0010023362,0.00057618925,0.0025791703

0,its all about termination not branches Branches are not always a problem They are the problem when they are long and not terminated If the unused branch was terminated there would be no echo to cause the problem Its a little confusing as its the AC impendance at the tail of the branch and in the frequency range of interest that would be deciding whether its terminated or not it could be terminated for one frequency and not terminated for another But The main point is that the lack of the device on the unused branch that is causing the echo any moron can see that the branch with the users device on it could also cause an echo if branches cause echo all three branches could cause echo What is the difference the lack of a device on the unused branch also The signal travelling down the branch is no problem of it self its the coming BACK that is the problem 202 92 33 42,0.0035465066,0.04656625,0.0033107193,0.00057362043,0.0013927686

0,I can t offer an offical document either that the classical language category was introduced by a constitutional decree but there are many notifications that are not published on the internet like the official notification that Tamil was declared Classical language However there are newspaper reports which confirm that the classical language category was introduced by constitutional decree So this is enough to prove it Also i found a conversation of the Indian parliament which illustrates the importance of the classical language status for India where Mr Shivraj V Patil compares the status of the scheduled languages to the status of the classical languages SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY Sir the demand for declaring Kannada as a classical language is pending before the Government since 2004 The same answer has been given earlier also My submission before the House is that the Kannada text and recorded history belongs to 252 BC The first Kannada literary work Kavirajamarga was created in 850 AD and it refers to some writings earlier than that The 12th Centaury Kannada Bhakti Movement in the form of Vachana or oral expression is unparallel In contemporary kirtana which subsequently became Karnataka Sangeet is an enduring contribution to Indian music Sir the epigraphical material in Kannada numbering over 25 000 inscriptions in stone and copper are rich in style and contents which are not found even in Tamil inscription The UNESCO records Kannada amongst the prime scripts of the world Sir Kannada is among the first living languages of the world in the history of continuous writing system spanning three millennium like Hebrew Chinese and Tamil SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY CONTD Sir the recognition was given to Tamil We do not grudge it Now Sir when the world recognises Kannada in India MR CHAIRMAN Please put your question SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY step motherly treatment is being given to Karnataka Agitations are going on in Karnataka About three days back about one lakh people gathered Everyday it is going on Has the Government recognised this Is the Government going to take any action on this and by what time SHRI SHIVRAJ V PATIL Sir Kannada is a very rich language ancient language The matter is before the Committee of Linguistic Experts constituted by the Ministry of Culture This matter is now with the Ministry of Culture They are looking into the matter There are demands made by one other section of the society with respect to their language Now these demands are being looked into by the Expert Committee and after the Expert Committee comes to any conclusion the Ministry of Culture will take a decision in the matter SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY Sir in reply to Unstarred Question No 1381 it was stated The Ministry of Culture had received presentation from various quarters for declaring Kannada as classical language A Committee of Linguistic Experts has been constituted to examine the claims of any language classical language status This Committee will advise the Government in the matter This answer was given on 6 3 2006 Subsequently to me also the Minister of Culture has replied saying that it has been referred Now the question before the House is as to how long it will go on like this There is a limit to the patience of the people also They are losing their patience You may not believe but they are condemning and criticising the Parliamentarians and saying that Karnataka M P s are dormant they are inactive MR CHAIRMAN Please ask the question Don t make a statement SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY How long will the Government take a decision After being referred to the Expert Committee there has been a lapse of one year what action is going to be taken by the Government MR CHAIRMAN Mr Poojary this is a supplementary question Please ask the question Don t make a statement SHRI SHIVRAJ V PATIL As a matter of fact this question should have been sent to the Ministry of Culture But because the notice was given to us and the notice was given at the last moment the question was accepted and we are replying to it As a matter of fact it is only the Ministry of Culture which is in a position to take a decision with respect to this and I would like to say that the language should unit language should not divide Many languages in our country are rich languages and they should be a source of our unity rather than division So it would be necessary for all of us to tell our brothers and sisters in the States that on the basis of language division should not be created Because the languages are rich because the languages are ancient because Interruptions SHRI JANARDH,0.0019766204,0.06272963,0.00204314,0.0010663967,0.0039471085

0,Origins The two paragraphs about the Christian allegorical theme about love and the two brides being based on two meanings of love which relate to the latin words amor and veritas seems contradictory to the fact that the story is apparently based on a Russian Jewish folktale Although the Christian Jewish contradiction may be attributed to the relationship between the two religions the fact that the entire thing is made clear by the fact that the meanings of love come out better in Latin raises a few red flags for me Hell Russian isn t even a Romance language On top of all that I can find no evidence that Theophile Guerin ever existed or his 1836 book about a monk and a dead woman It s very interesting as an idea but since this information of Guerin is given rather than a citation I say that the entire two paragraphs should be IMMEDIATELY deleted However I ve already spent too much time writing all this and researching that and am too unsure to actually delete it If i get around to rechecking this discussion and no one has said anything or disagreed I will edit the entry as there is no citation and it seems unfactual and invented fictional THalleck,0.003742136,0.008823319,0.009579692,0.0007849457,0.0023593227

0,If you can come up with facts about where the Pashtuns originated from then I will call the CIA and the United Nations to correct their map chart and findings If you fail to do this then go along with what the claims of the Pashtuns are You are just a normal person with limited knowledge about people Do not act like you know more then CIA and the United Nations The maps you keep showing is dated from 1980 made by an unknown agency It is posted at Hazara net which is a site of Hazara people Meaning these maps of yours are bogus Afghanistan is soon going to have census and the mystery will be solved about the exact number of people of each ethnic group In fact they were suppose to do this a year ago but failed so far The number of votes Hamid Karzai recieved is enough proof that Pashtuns are very high number in Afghanistan As we all know that it s not normal for NON Pashtuns to vote for a Pashtun leader check Politics and government of Afghanistan where the number of votes Karzai recieved And don t give me any comments or excuses to that,0.18271573,0.4836624,0.0018471683,0.0009203277,0.0025816334

0,December 2005 UTC Response to the lies in your RFC TAB HiTAB I posted this response to your RFC on Canaen TAB I believe you removed it I would like to point out that in British English the word nark is non pejorative and I understand that it has an objective meaning something akin to a snitch in American That is meaning someone that makes often erroneous allegations to authorities in order to personally benefit themselves in some way TAB The funniest thing for me is that you are busy digging a hole in your own canoe because your allegations are lies You are entirely wrong I know this because I know who I am and I know with whom I have and have had connections and I take a very minor little offence at being accused by the likes of you of being something I am not I state very minor little offence because you and your views genuinely are so unimportant TAB You are an individual of very little decency and integrity I do not state this as an insult but as an objective statement You have been told on many occasions that I have no connection with this or these other individuals and yet you not only continue to go on making such allegations but you even use them as the ground to make an attack on another individual TAB Don t worry Karma will come and get you in its own time TAB TAB User conduct RFC TAB Please be advised that I have filed a user conduct RFC on you It can be found here Cheers TAB Just out of interest who do you think this nark is and why is he so motivated to go about doing what he is doing I put this record up in the open for you and them to see because I have no and have had no connection with you nor any of the journal pages and frankly I take offence at being called a meat or sockpuppet of yours when I am not I am sure that you are just or even more upset as being accused of a connection with me when you have none TAB Unfortunately though that is the depth of s lies and the shallowness of s integrity TAB Where he has no grounds he invents them and he is oh so clever at playing WikiTricks with all these technical terms and methods TAB I am starting to feel like a Jew in Nazi Germany being hunted down connected to individuals which I have no connection with and their so called crimes and accused of crimes which are not mine TAB And what of He just seems to get off on throwing around his weight whilst avoiding entering into the actually factual discussion TAB TABTAB TAB For the record and let them love every minute of their persecution syndrome let them avidly copy and paste and make little weblinks to this as they are so good at Wikitricks I am a vegan of 20 years or more standing and arguably MacDonald of Clanranald I became involved in editing the vegan article before you returned to it recently I am entirely responsible for kicking this whole thing off because I refused to let get away with his ridiculous domination of the article and I put in the same category for his anorexic stuff TAB From my point of view my objections are largely literary The article became too bloated and required editing down It is merely meant to be a definition of what vegan is I don t see any point in actually engaging in those that oppose veganism I don t even support vegan s trying to counter counter vegan propaganda on the Wiki It is best to keep it short and simple and give a few links so that folks that are interested can go find out more TAB I approached reasonably and got the same sort of response as you did see When started to engage in his revisions without consultation I tried to engage him in reasonable discussion see But he just ignores it TAB Fine I showed respect they showed themselves for what they are TAB I find it weird in a way that individuals can become so obsessed by something that they obviously do not love but instead want to demean or destroy and that means you now and are willing to invest so much time and energy into it TAB I could understand it if was a paid employee of the meat industry he says he has professional scientific interest in animal husbandry That would just make him a paid publicist But if he is do,0.11067754,0.10828195,0.0022990622,0.00064551854,0.0018913109

0,Fish man hello and welcome to Wikipedia Thank you for taking the time to examine Wikipedia policies and base your arguments for keeping No boo on them and also for being polite when making your arguments VfD pages really aren t the place for me to be making lengthy arguments so I ll respond to your points here instead First you should be aware that anonymous users who sign up for accounts just to argue about the article being voted on are still effectively anonymous users and are still not going to have their votes counted At this point I think it is really too late for you to establish a history at Wikipedia that would result in your vote being counted Again I refer you to Wikipedia Deletion guidelines for administrators for this information Anonymous authors who request that their articles be deleted are often given consideration but not those who want them kept Whether they re specifically enumerated on What Wikipedia is not or not articles about neologisms are not encyclopedia material Firstly on that page indicates that Wikipedia articles are not dictionary definitions and as a neologism is just a particular kind of word an article on a neologism is necessarily a dictionary definition Secondly encyclopedia articles cannot describe neologisms because they cannot describe things that are as yet unestablished No boo may or may not be a word with some currency today but it remains to be seen whether it will become part of the language Once we can determine that the term has staying power and is culturally or historically significant which time will likely not come for months or years then we can write an article on it Or rather we could if it weren t going to be just a dictionary definition If the article in question is not about a word but actually about an event called The No boo Affair then it ought to be entitled No boo Affair In that case I would still vote to delete it on the grounds that it is a news story Again there is no evidence at this time that this news story is going to have any historical significance and considering that the substance of the news story is the AP made a mistake they said some people booed at a speech but really nobody did it seems very unlikely that it will ever have historical significance You characterize the AP s error as a clear falsification but I see no evidence of malicious intent by the AP and anyway it s still not an encyclopedia s job to document falsehoods by the AP If the AP has a history or pattern of such falsehoods and it is well documented by other unbiased sources then we can make a note of it in Associated Press If the term no boo becomes well established which again we will not know for months or years then perhaps it will be appropriate for us to record this news story as the origin of the term Certainly Wikipedia has articles on other recent news stories However most are stories of definite historical signficance and those that are not should also be deleted Wikipedia wants articles on items that are currently in the news yes In this case there are many things related to the story that people might want to look up If we didn t already have them we could add articles on George W Bush William J Clinton West Allis Wisconsin booing the Associated Press the White House the Republican National Convention New York etc But this No boo Affair is not an encyclopedic topic in the news it is a breaking news story It is important to understand that an encyclopedia is not simply a gathering of assorted facts but rather a secondary source that compiles significant pieces of human knowledge that have already been well established by other sources There are many places on the internet and offline where you can disseminate facts and opinions about this event but Wikipedia is not one of them 18 08 15 Sep 2004 UTC,0.3672169,0.042526692,0.00046414539,0.00059444195,0.0013375775

0,Not my business to go and unearth the original source documents If you read widely enough instead of relying on large overview sources and have more than a superficial interest in the subject sooner or later you might unearth the original documents which are surprisingly easy to come by A large portion of the naval history books I have listed in my library came off the internet for nothing and if you re lucky you ll find books which quote documents verbatim Last weekend I had the great pleasure to take advantage of a incompetent error made by the National Archives and was able to download a few dozen service records for free instead of the hundreds of pounds of the five hundred pounds thousand dollars plus I would normally have had to pay Already I have seen where certain historians Gordon in The Rules of the Game is one have obviously not checked the service record and made false assertions about certain officers and also where they have cited the service record yet written something entirely different Marder is interesting because in his twenties he was possibly the last person to look at a great deal of Admiralty literature It s bad enough that in many cases he doesn t cite specifically the details of the correspondence involved but it really didn t help that the Naval Historical Section literally purged untold numbers of documents a process which was finally halted in the late fifties Therefore quite literally a lot of Marder s scholarship depends on his reputation and not the facts talk,0.013178869,0.01499355,0.0010127559,0.0005804333,0.0020019056

0,Thanks for the reply my biggest issue at the moment is whether to include sales figures for earlier years as far as I know there were no published end of year sales figures before 1994 and the sales published at the time for 1994 to 1996 have since been discredited and revised so are basically worthless The figures currently quoted in the articles up to 1996 are usually estimates that have been taken from various charts message boards calculated by enthusiasts from officially published yearly sales figures per artist i e sales could be made up of one or more singles or albums and estimating what percentage of sales were assigned to each record As these are completely unofficial and unverifiable I am thinking to remove them altogether or at least add a note that all figures are unofficial and estimated In any case I don t think most people are interested in how many records the 37th best selling album of 1987 sold that year it makes more sense to me to concentrate efforts into keeping List of best selling singles in the United Kingdom up to date,0.0063972445,0.0048357444,0.00048078966,0.0005692301,0.0013840399

0,John As you know the lead in sentence for this article is In mathematics a bivector is a quantity in geometric algebra that generalizes the idea of a vector That is this article in WP is about the bivector in geometric algebra although it could be redesigned to deal with tensor algebra I suppose which topic is presently an afterthought at the end As such the section on Vector algebra is a subheading of the main topic the bivector in geometric algebra Consequently the reference to the pseudovector in this subsection should make note of the predominant usage in texts on geometric algebra namely that the bivector in 3D is the pseudovector just another example of the n 1 grade multivector being the pseudovector No Do you disagree about the common usage On that basis it is not exactly a mis statement but certainly an easily mis read statement in the article that says in geometric algebra axial vectors are usually interpreted as bivectors In fact what is usual and less open to misconception is awrynowicz Hence in 3D we associate the alternate terms of pseudovector for bivector and pseudoscalar for the trivector I will produce five more quotes from other sources if you wish,0.008755927,0.7101131,0.0019944506,0.0005691718,0.0013355128

0,History of Palestine national football team We should show both viewpoints and matches claimed to be the first internationals played by Palestine or Israel in 1934 and 1953 if we want to be righteous and give a civilized image for Wikipedia Note that the British mandate used the term Palestine predominately not Israel I as a Palestinian try and wants to be neutral as much as I can however when it comes to stealing my country s sport history I became very angry and I feel injustice According to many sources a part of them says that Palestine came to existence in football for the first in 1928 and played vs Egypt in the World Cup Qualification and the other part says that the Palestinian Football Association was inherited by the Israeli one in 1948 We can not be 100 sure which part is right so that requires to follow both parties to not disappoint any people from Palestine and Israel as well as avoiding editing wars that have occurred in the past Sources A History of Palestine From the Ottoman Conquest to the Founding of The State of Israel by Gudrun Kr mer Sports around the World History Culture and Practice by John Nauright and Charles Parrish,0.012406871,0.0062053166,0.0064005125,0.0007277175,0.0019047416

0,I ll have to take a closer look at the current version of the article because I have an uneasy feeling that the answer actually is found in one of the subsidiary articles such as Lydian mode The short answer is that the connection between the Greek harmoniai and the medieval modes is more tenuous than you appear to believe and the connection between medieval and modern modes is fairly straightforward The modern system is actually that of Common Practice Tonality and modal usage within that context begins to establish itself as a separate idea during the 18th century The chief difference from medieval practice is a more rigid adherence to the diatonic notes of the scale For example in the medieval system there is no practical difference between the Lydian scale and what we call the major scale or between the Dorian and what we call the minor scale In order to differentiate modal flavor from the chromatic flexibility of the upper half of the minor scale for example it became necessary to insist on always using the minor seventh scale degree especially in ascent to the tonic and the sixth degree had to be always major to identify Dorian and always minor to identify Aeolian No such practice existed up to the 16th century and indeed it was only with Glareanus in the mid 16th century that a theoretical difference was made between Dorian and Aeolian on the one hand and Lydian and Ionian on the other I shall see what I can do to clear this up using reliable sources of course,0.0065765935,0.00582018,0.0009819682,0.0005694846,0.0018348782

0,They don t demand anything What is specifically said is this We urge Secretary of the Interior Donald P Hodel to undertake immediately a feasibility study leading to a recommendation for draining Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and restoring Hetch Hetchy Valley and We call upon all interests to take an open minded long view of this issue and to study and assess alternatives to meeting their needs and concerns through alternative sources of water power and revenue But it s kind of hard to frame that as them wanting to bomb the dam isn t it You also don t mention that debate and studies on the matter were still ongoing as of 2006 Frankly if that s the quality of your writing I can see why you re editing at Conservapedia 76 105 223 232,0.048488807,0.044149313,0.0011858423,0.0005746123,0.0016460308

0,Confusing I tagged this article as confusing due to the Structure part It reads Red Hat Enterprise Linux is largely composed of software packages distributed under free software and or open source licenses but is made available in a usable binary form such as on CD ROM or DVD ROM media or download only to paying subscribers However it does not explain what is the meaning of paying subscribers i e what do the subscribers pay for For getting RHEL in a CD ROM Definitely they don t pay 100 dollars for getting it in a CD or DVD they pay it for the support However the article skips that Red Hat offers support as abruptly says CentOS is freely available for download and use by the public but is not maintained or supported by Red Hat instead of using something like this RHEL though licensed at GPL must be bought from Red Hat since they provide full maintenance and support for it However CentOS is not supported by Red Hat and is thus freely available for download and use by the public I will try to cleanup the article once I get the time for it Talk,0.0066468655,0.006777132,0.0023089864,0.0005723799,0.0014960897

0,I am not sure if I understand your reply above correctly UNSD uses the term statistics divisions I agree but the term refers to division s in the UN headquarter or agencies in different countries NOT a specific way of geographic divisions of the world You still prefer previous title i e United Nations statistical divisions to the current one i e United Nations geoscheme If so please allow me to repeat a bit on the following The term Statistics Division capitalized singular form in the UN context refers to the organization of United Nations Statistics Division with the website at unstats un org The term statistical divisions plural form can mean any categorization schemes not just geographical ones Google this statistical divisions site un org The term statistical divisions plural form can ALSO mean any organization bodies who are doing statisitcal work in governments Google this statistical divisions site un org Therefore it is not advisable to use the ambigous general term statistical divisions or the wrong organization term Statistics Division to refer to UN M 49 UN statistical divisions can refer to any agencies doing statisitcal work under the UN system or imply that there are certain UN statistical categorization schemes in a general sense not geographical I agree that UN geoscheme is widely used for stastitcs and ALSO mapping Natural Earth has region un and subregion metadata for each country I use it quiet often It is why I notice that most of academic work refer this geographic categorization classification scheme as UN geoscheme Try Google BOOK search and you will find at least the following The best option to identify the states from Asia could be use the United Nations UN geoscheme for Asia As per this Asia is subdivided to four broad categories The UN geoscheme defines the region as all states of mainland North America south of the United States conversely the European Union excludes Belize and Mexico from its definition of the region Country groups are based on UN Geoscheme and World Bank regional classification were grouped into regions and subregions based on the United Nations Geoscheme unsd methods m49 m49regin htm that the United Nations Statistics Division would later classify as Eastern Asia Southern Asia and Southeastern Asia according to its geoscheme In fact I also agree that many UN agencies in fact many other reports consultancies etc have different statistical divisions in the general sense of categorization schemes for research This is exactly why I believe the term UN geoscheme is better Although it is NOT official term or a technical term UN M 49 I have not yet found an ambigous use of the term Correct me if I am wrong on this so far every online and academic citations that I have found when the term UN geoscheme is used it refers to exactly the regions and subregions as defined in UN M 49 Moving forwards since don t have the time nor will to take it to RM and if you do not have any further couter evidence or arguments with the evidence and claims that I layed out above I can help by making the necessary editing without going to RM Of course if you still have lingering concerns please summarize your current arguments preferrably after considering the evidence that I have already presented and new evidence citations here before I bring it to RM comparingChinese Wikipedia vs Baidu Baike by hanteng,0.012107177,0.015666237,0.00041653373,0.0005726263,0.0020239113

0,Re Correlation and dependence article Hi again and well done for registering Regarding the link that you were are wanting to add to the Correlation and dependence article I suggest the following i you could best make your points for inclusion on the article s talk discussion page so that others can comment the edit summary and user s talk pages are not good for this ii you could try to find a place in the article to make some kind of helpful reference to this link s content that is an inline citation rather than it just appearing in a bald way under External links so that readers would know that the link is meant to be useful regarding interpretation iii if you feel that this link does have something particularly useful to say or a good way of looking at things then you could try to summarise re state these points within the article itself again you could ask for opinions help on the article s talk page but there is really no reason why you shouldn t go ahead and add something My own opinion is that adding plain external links should be avoided once an article has substantial content A previous editor mentioned linkspam and while this link might not quite fit within that term the website itself didn t seem to have a lot of other content but I could be wrong and the substantiality of the source has some bearing on whether a link is appropriate If you have an inclination to help in improving the content of the statistics articles more generally you should see Wikipedia WikiProject Statistics There is certainly need for help in improving the understandability of all of the statistics articles so don t be put off if there seems to be an emphasis on mathematical technicalities,0.24661008,0.011313301,0.00048562427,0.00057105167,0.0024005782

0,I agree Lambert asserts that he was first published source so this part is not totally original research The verifiability see wp v of his claim is questionable Why should Wikipedia report Lambert s version without independant verification of his claims He is not a recognised authority on academic or religious terminology O Brien is another primary source she doesn t work for the OED or any of the usual places we go to when we want an authorative answer to when terms originated Also O Brien does not directly credit Lambert so even this source doesn t directly support the article text Also neither Lambert nor O Brien state that the term was ever used to define a style of Celtic Studies What we really need is a citation that states that the Harvest magazine really was the first appearance,0.0036223428,0.0049358187,0.0018689389,0.00057098735,0.0016916444

0,I would say that the bottom line is if independent reliable sources describe Cox as Catholic then we can go with that The difference is that Cox belongs to a schismatic organization that is several levels removed from the Catholic Church Williamson in his association with the SSPX was directly ordained by a Catholic Church bishop and remained Catholic even while not in full communion Note that the Catholic Church affirmed that attendance at an SSPX chapel would fulfill the Sunday obligation i e in a Catholic rite I do not know if the Catholic Church has commented on the canonical status of the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church or the validity of the Thuc line of apostolic succession My suggestion for a succinct description of Cox would be Independent Catholic bishop as that is how his church is described,0.4416045,0.005758985,0.004252119,0.00058486755,0.00298154

0,6 November 2007 UTC Ah yes You two know that it probably isn t prudent for me to say much about him now Instead let s take a different tack okay A challenge to those at WP AN A number of people have been discussing various moves by me In an attempt to help clarify the issues I respectfully issue the following challenge Go to Wikipedia Requested moves and make a request for Eduardo Perez to be moved to Eduardo P rez providing the proper discussion space on the talk page in accordance with the instructions at WP RM etc Then give everyone who has commented about my moving articles should be given a chance to weigh in on that requested move Put together all that collective brainpower and more importantly all that spirit of cooperative editing to work to try to resolve the question of which of those two names should occupy the unique spot available for the article s name in accordance with our Wikipedia Naming conventions Consider what you could support based on the article as it stands today with nothing specifically identified as a reference but with two entries under External links to statistics pages Based on what I could see in other words Look for and discuss additional sources of information to support either the Eduardo P rez spelling or the Eduardo Perez spelling Add appropriate references to the article if they are reliable sources If anyone who has commented about me in this regard hasn t jumped in of his or her own accord within a couple of days seek them out and specifically invite their input to achieve the best cooperative result This will provide a wonderful opportunity to teach by example Then no matter where it ends up we will probably accomplish one thing Those who want to talk about naming conventions issues will at least have some little bit of experience with and understanding for the potential issues involved History This article was started with the name Eduardo Perez more than two years ago and remained that way until moved to Eduardo P rez without discussion and no edit summary here 10 Oct 2007 by User Kolins Later I moved back the undiscussed unreferenced move of the longstanding name There have been no edits since and Talk Eduardo Perez is a blank slate unused but for the ubiquitous WikiProjects and BLP boxes filling up a couple of screens Or perhaps it would be even more instructive to add one additional step first Let Husond first show you how an old pro one well versed in the workings of Wikipedia would handle this Let him first move it back to Eduardo P rez then request page protection on the page Then once that page protection is in place you can request the move in the opposite direction from Eduardo P rez to Eduardo Perez Same encouragement of participation by anyone involved in that WP AN discussion of course no matter which direction the move is requested All that changes is the burden of proof something Husond is well aware of but might not have been considered by everyone else It might have some effect on the ensuing discussion or not I can t predict what will happen in this case Leave the discussion open for the normal five days or more with of course anyone who is following the article just because they are baseball fanatics or whatever free to jump into the discussion as well That discussion of course ought to be able to proceed quite smoothly and amicable since you won t have to worry about a disruptive character like me jumping in there Does that sound do able Either direction I don t care You choose 19 13,0.0037745761,0.021700092,0.0012774786,0.00056864903,0.0027433427

0,Fowler has thoughtfully invited me on my Talk page to comment Nichalp says in the present thread The term British India is generally used in popular parlance to separate independent India from British governed India I am sure there is some truth in that but I think the reply is that Wikipedia shouldn t about popular parlance it is an encyclopedia and needs to be about scholarship about detailed and correct information sourced as well as possible To put that more grandly it is about educating the world To illustrate this point in the popular parlance of much of the world Great Britain and England are much the same thing but by education people learn the difference between them To have an article on British India here even one with much improvement needed to it is a powerful tool in that process of education On Nichalp s suggestion that British India should be redirected to British Raj I and others do not agree with that for all of the detailed reasons advanced so far please see the discussion here and also at Talk British Raj And I believe Philip Baird Shearer has said correctly somewhere above that there is a consensus against such a redirect Fowler asks Would you be opposed to British India being redirected to this overview article British rule in India instead of British Raj I of course am one of those who believe Wikipedia needs a discrete article so I should be opposed In general I do agree with the overview article idea which has developed and if I am invited to help in particular ways then I shall be glad to do what I can but I do not believe British India would be a possible title for that overview article as the term has a correct meaning which is significantly less than the whole of India One thought which I believe Fowler had some time ago which does strike me as another possible compromise would be to merge Provinces of British India into British India For reasons of space the separation might one day be an advantage but as matters stand at the moment this might be a rationalisation which could make sense to all of us I hope these comments are helpful,0.021475166,0.17571387,0.001150381,0.0005761723,0.002622164

0,Arbitration enforcement action appeal by WookieInHeat Procedural notes The rules governing arbitration enforcement appeals are found in this 2010 ArbCom motion According to that motion a clear substantial and active consensus of uninvolved editors is required to overturn an arbitration enforcement action To help determine any such consensus involved editors may make brief statements in separate sections but should not edit the section for discussion among uninvolved editors Editors are normally considered involved if they are in a current dispute with the sanctioning or sanctioned editor or have taken part in disputes if any related to the contested enforcement action Administrators having taken administrative actions are not normally considered involved for this reason alone see WP UNINVOLVED Appealing user Sanction being appealed Blocked for 48 hours for Personal attacks or harassment NPA and ARBPIA violation accused editor of supporting terrorism Discussion of sanctions at WP AE Administrator imposing the sanction Notification of that administrator The appealing editor is asked to notify the administrator who made the enforcement action of this appeal and then to replace this text with a diff of that notification The appeal may not be processed otherwise If a block is appealed the editor moving the appeal to this board should make the notification Statement by WookieInHeat Georgewilliamherbert s reason for blocking me relied solely upon the idea that i personally attacked Nableezy by accusing him of supporting terrorism from an absolutist POV nowhere in any edit was the word terrorism even mentioned my observation that nableezy s political POV on wikipedia aligns with the political goals of hamas was by no means meant as a personal attack nor to insinuate the more abstract idea of nableezy s support for terrorism my primary intention was to highlight nableezy s possible WP COI with the subject while he was pushing to have negative information about it removed my main point here is that i find george s reasoning for my block to have been rather arbitrary and ambiguous also the duration of the blocks handed out seems somewhat irrational nableezy a user with a lengthy history of often thinly veiled and sometimes outright personal attacks not to mention numerous complaints about their civility was given only a token block of three hours for a direct personal attack whereas i have no significant or pertinent history of incivility and was blocked for 16 times that length 48 hours for what some have misconstrued as a personal attack based on the wholly fabricated idea that i called someone a terrorism supporter not to mention nableezy plainly knew that his blatant personal attack would result in a ban where i went to some length to clarify that my comment was not a personal attack also i did not respond when nableezy attacked me directly and i was the first user to drop the argument and bring the discussion back to the topic at hand i really cannot stress enought the fact that i never accused nableezy of supporting terrorism not only did i never directly say this it was never even implied by my comments thus it would seem my block was based entirely on a misconception of what was meant when i said nableezy displays his affinity for the palestinian cause and by association hamas implying this was actually instead intended to say nableezy displays his affinity for the palestinian cause and by association terrorism this is simply not the case and frankly i am somewhat offended myself at george s insinuation that i would arbitrarily class,0.039227977,0.023914507,0.007324266,0.0005686233,0.0014375111

0,Cleanup During Pearl Jam s concert at the Orange Stage in 2000 a violent accident occurred Nine people died in front of the stage The exact conditions as to how they died have been examined by both the police and the public prosecutor and at subsequent civil trials the conclusion of these determines that it was an accident Many people fell down which often happens at big concerts but at one place they did not get up again Some crowdsurfers fell into this hole and are believed to have been factors of the event turning wrong crowdsurfing was subsequently forbidden across most of Europe The people at the bottom died of suffocation When the security guards in front of the stage got to the area after the music had been stopped it was too late In the following year the accident led to massive changes with regards to safety to avoid similar situations not just at Roskilde Festival the security conditions for festivals everywhere in Europe changed Before the accident in 2000 Roskilde Festival was considered one of the safest festivals and yet the accident happened there Many other festivals have smaller safety systems than Roskilde Festival and revised their procedures even further For instance Glastonbury Festival in England chose to cancel its festival in 2001 to have enough time to reorganize the safety planning since the festival in 2000 was not at all at level with Roskilde Festival Each year Roskilde Festival makes an extensive health and safety assessment which the festival is executed on the basis of The accident at the Orange Stage led to the construction of a memorial grove with a stone with the inscription How fragile we are surrounded by nine trees Seriously this bit needs cleanup flash,0.05168899,0.05255272,0.022750048,0.0007511496,0.0016605716

0,The titles need not show that the characters are related all about this is in the articles You see the nature of fiction is that it s not necessarily coherent Since this article is not about Malcolm Wilkerson in the first episode of the show Malcolm in the Middle but about the character throughout the show it is indeed inaccurate to use a name for the character that was only used for the pilot episode For the entire rest of the seven season run the character s name was only Malcolm This is not a question of beauty or taste but of plain accuracy A title like Malcolm XXX my appear clumsy but Wilkerson is not an alternative In my opinion If can t build consensus on this between the two of us I suggest asking for additional input at Wikipedia talk Naming conventions since I didn t find anything in the guidelines for a specific case like this although I m fairly sure the fact that the character s name was Wilkerson only during the first of 151 episodes of the show means that calling the character Wilkerson esp in the title is inaccurate,0.002441486,0.007568318,0.00595511,0.0005774736,0.0013752019

0,Obviously I wasn t referring to good faith edits intended to help people or to help improve the article we all appreciate those I was referring to uninformed edits and reverts of edits that added to the article There s no need to lecture me on wp thanks for the offer tho this is the first time that I have seen such aggressive uninformed editing in years I was not at all trying to own the article what I was trying is making sure that informed edits go through In case you didn t notice I previously asked for the article to be LOCKED for public editing to lock out certain people including myself to ensure that only a handful of people with a demonstrated background in aviation can review edits while others could help with stylistic stuff and proper refs quoting At the end of the day I have given up now and I won t bother wasting any more time debating things here as usual interest will degrade over time and some jackass type personalities will probably remove themselves sooner or later probably the ones who just happen to be around accident related articles because of recent news coverage at the moment there s simply too much public interest and what s happening isn t just a wp specific issue there s lots of layman s discussion taking place everywhere without really adding to the quality of discussion Finally what s been happening here wouldn t be tolerated in a commercial environment with professional editors where responsibility has to be assigned to individuals encyclopedic or not Again this is nothing personal and against anybody here I do realize that there are team dynamics at work here and I have seen tons of editing wars going on here not just due to my own edits so I really don t take it personally But I would hope for wikipedia to adopt some sort of policy workflow and procedures for such hot events to ensure a higher degree of QA not just based on wp seniority status but based on people who have some related professional background wp isn t going to fail obviously but 5 10 years from now the behavior tolerated here by some wannabe experts will no longer be tolerated and corresponding procedures will be put in place to differentiate between content and markup contributions,0.18593757,0.0062760552,0.00078631914,0.000593251,0.0018507235

0,Progressive Conservative Party still exists According to your Rump section there are still Progressive Conservatives who sit in parliament So the party is not dead See the extract below Rump PC caucus Following the merger a rump Progressive Conservative caucus remained in Parliament consisting of individuals who declined to join the new Conservative Party In the House of Commons Joe Clark Andr Bachand and John Herron sat as PC members In the 2004 election Bachand and Clark did not to run for re election and Herron ran as a Liberal losing to Rob Moore in his riding of Fundy Royal Scott Brison who had joined the Liberal caucus immediately upon departing the Conservative Party was reelected as a Liberal in the 2004 election In the Senate William Doody Lowell Murray and Norman Atkins also declined to join the new party and continue to sit as Progressive Conservative senators On March 24 2005 Prime Minister Paul Martin appointed nine new senators two of whom Nancy Ruth and Elaine McCoy were designated as Progressive Conservatives Thus there may be Progressive Conservative senators until 2021 when McCoy the youngest of the five attains the mandatory retirement age of 75 or later if subsequent senators designate themselves Progressive Conservatives Nancy Ruth has since left to sit with the Conservative Party Adding the death of Senator Doody on December 27 2005 this reduced the number of PC Senators to three,0.02814027,0.03081585,0.0014305536,0.0005728599,0.0012587886
0,This info is all messed up Pit bull is a slang term that describes several types of dogs with similar physical characteristics There are several physically similar breeds that are often termed pit bull including the American Pit Bull Terrier American Staffordshire Terrier the Staffordshire Bull Terrier the Bull Terrier the Perro de Presa Canario Cane Corso and Argentine Dogos These breeds are usually not included by name in any Breed Specific Legislation see below but are sometimes included because of a broad definition and confusion as to what a pit bull actually is 1 All of these breeds as well as many others including Great Danes Newfoundlands and Rottweilers are members of the Molosser family of dog breeds 1 Pitbull is NOT a slang its just one of the nicknames och shortened names the breed has had during the years Those that use it for dogs other then Pitbulls are just ignorant and dont have the facts surrounding the breed clear to them often used by journalists and people without any background info Its a pure breed dog registered under UKC since 1898 its beeing registered under American pitbull Terrier under a few more registrys such as ADBA BFKC in USA I dont know why this site that is set to be some kind of kowledge base allows itself to have this info at the top of the page All it does is to confuse people that come in here to read and to find out more about the breed If this is the first thing a visitor reads then it often sticks to his her mind as truth and he leaves the site If a reader comes in here to search facts because he her is unsure about what a Pitbull is because of medias coverage then this info just confirmes to him her that there is no such thing as a real Pitbull with is as far from the truth you may come There are so many myths and hearsays around this breed so i suggest the top info to be rewritten and only contain FACTS Many countries have their own Kennelclubs and they are all tied together by FCI as an international organ But FCI only works with 1 kennelclub per country and if a dog aint listed in that club other countries follow FCI regulations and do the same This is why FCI dossent recognize the Pitbull as a pure breed They work with AKC American Kennel Club that dossent keep register of the Pitbull But the American Staffordshire Terrier Pitbulls as i said erlier was first registered with UKC United Kennel Club and because only one club per country is allowed in FIC regulations the Pitbull was left outside due to a tecnicality This is the same in several countries The national kennelclubs is tied to follow FCI regulations if they are members and thats why Sweden for example dossent recognize the pitbull in their own kennel klub SKK Why did i say all this then Well it goes back to what i wrote erlier If a person think that Pitbull just is a slang and not a pure breed as written at top of Wikipedia site about pitbulls and lives in Sweden for example then this sites info add more to the myths So if a moderator reads this please think hard about what signals the top text about Pitbulls sends out to this pages viewers Niklas Sweden,0.13016145,0.021942513,0.13083099,0.0011613248,0.084944285

0,TRPV1 agonist It makes no sense TRPV1 activation causes pain or heat sensation Capsaicine is known to activate the receptor and that s what makes chili pungent If one of the reasons for AM404 being an analgetic was TRPV1 activation it would have to be the opposite to that of capsaicine The only wat in which TRPV1 agonism would decrease pain is that a prolonged exposure to high doses of the agonist decreases the sensitivity which is the case in any type of receptor activation but this would mean that AM404 is no more an analgetic than capsaicine or any other source of pain and the relief would come after a period of pain actually getting worse Can anyone explain all this,0.061185937,0.22328389,0.13702902,0.0013784964,0.002077398

0,Userbox Hi Strangely someone deleted a userbox of yours as T1 even though it was userfied I assume this was a simple mistake on the part of the deleter so I ve restored it for you Best wishes Actually I was unaware the thing was already at DRV when I undeleted Technically one probably should wait to undelete until the DRV is over so I unintentionally goofed a bit Still the deletion was clearly a mistake in process and content which is quite mild Looking at the RfC and DRV I don t see that Dmcdevit has defended it at all so I ll continue to assume he was simply confused Although I understand your unhappiness your RfC is a little bit premature one speedy deletion can be a simple mistake which everybody makes A pattern of bad choices and an unwillingness to reconsider them would be required to initiate an RfC really Dmcdevit is a very nice person even if he wasn t mistaken in the deletion and genuinely had a problem with the userbox he isn t the type to object to taking the debate to MfD the proper forum at the very least Thanks for the kind words I ve been off wiki for a bit but I ll be getting around to my old beat soon which includes DRV normally so should you have other problems I ll be happy to help Best wishes On looking at the DRV again I do notice Dmcdevit there and he isn t arguing a sound position although he is being civil Surprising I must say Anyway I hope he s just having bad day I ve probably been grumpy myself lately what with the flu the snow the relatives etc last word in The first question you need to ask yourself is do I have a history perhaps as yet unadmitted of being overly critical of myself If the answer to this might be yes then you can t always trust your own tendency to self criticize because your subconscious motivation is not self improvement but self denigration don t pay that too much heed then If however the answer is no then if you notice a behavior of yours that bothers you listen to the notice and decide cognitively how much it really bothers you or should bother you Sometimes we only notice what bugs us about ourselves by trying to observe ourselves objectively You might be doing that and you might do well to listen but it s hard for me to weigh this As for my own opinion looking at Wikipedia Categories for deletion Log 2006 December 11 you haven t added anything that was redundant so I wouldn t say it s an issue If the discussion gets long and people keep bringing up things that you ve already answered remember that the closing admin is going to read everything and they should notice if you ve already answered a repeated objection Then it s a question of how much faith you have in the admins I know I m treading on very thin ice now For instance I made sure to answer everything at Wikipedia Articles for deletion Faith Freedom International because I wanted to be absolutely certain that if the article did get deleted I couldn t blame myself for not trying everything I m likely to do the same thing at Wikipedia Deletion review Log 2006 December 5 Sina if anyone opposes the citations I ve dug up But my motivation here is dedication to freedom of speech and for less critical articles I leave my comments for the admin and let it go A rule of thumb that you should know is that if an article is up for deletion and 80 of the votes are keep it will probably be kept even though it s not a vote If it s less than 80 then the keepers will have to put forward a pretty solid argument to keep As you can see at the Faith Freedom AfD keepers had about 66 and we just barely came through with no consensus I suspect that the factors that weighed most heavily for the admin were TruthSpreader s and my arguements as almost no one else seriously argued the merits of the citations and notability guidelines Hope all that helps talk Why Assume good faith and assume again I d been on alert for vandalism on Baiji and its talk page Talk Baiji for days ever since it went on the main page when I noticed this edit by User Dante Alighieri Dante Alighier,0.061792474,0.7480581,0.0009346829,0.00058191415,0.0023795734
0,Firstly where did you all get the idea that Association football is the correct official name for the sport It might be the official name for that sport in America just like how in the rest of the world the official name for the kind of football played in America is American football But obviously rest of the world is a bigger domain than America so the general consensus should be what most people in the world feel Secondly people do refer to football as soccer in UK no one is denying that But if people say that they are going to watch a football match it obviously means a soccer match not a rugby match Just because a very small minority in the world feels football refers to some other sport why should we insult the beautiful game by not devoting the page on football to football as the world knows it Majority of the world refers to Osama Bin Laden as a terrorist But there are still many people in the world who refers to Osama as a freedom fighter So does that mean we say Osama Bin Laden is a freedom fighter No When you have 6 billion people in the world and more than 5 billion refer to football as the FIFA version which is a very very large majority the fact that FIFa has more members than the UN and the fact that FIFA has the word football in it should justify that fact then shouldnt the general consensus swerve towards the majority Anyways nice to know that we have a lot of American users here,0.0023987975,0.06941636,0.0037755512,0.00061301136,0.0015412832

0,Gren not in my whole talk did I ever mention that images are not allowed in Islam It is your prejudiced thought that is again forcing you to be conservative and narrow minded The whole purpose for me to take part in this dialogue is to present my ideas that the posting of the depiction is unfair Hojimachong I would much rather be happy to get a quick response to my argument by removing the false depiction thus making Wikipedia more authentic and accurate 08 22 18 February 2007 UTC You ain t fooling anyone No sock puppet accusations They do no good If you have some information to that end deal with it with check user or however you must Checkuser instructs us not to bring forth obvious disruptive e g one who engages in personal attacks sockpuppets who are instead to be unceremoniously blocked Or do you disagree If you would care to read the discussion that has been ongoing for over a month you would know that it isn t going to be removed because of the whims of one editor talkcon I still am open for refuting that tirade against me Checkmeout talkcon Since you seem not want to repost your rant on my talk page I ll respond here Quoting me out of context isn t appropriate The very next sentence was I try hard to make Wikipedia be neutral and not give undue weight to any religion including Christianity this encyclopedia is operated by narrow minded individuals who least care about authenticity of the material posted on their website Considering the amount of time myself and other editors have spent on this page your blanket allegations I find extremely offensive though not as much of your allegation of me as a Christian radical editor I am sure that if you re analyze the entire argument you would find that the reasoning presented by most people in this little discussion board is fair and a decision to remove the picture undistorted by emotion would finally be made For lack of a better word this seems like hypocrisy to me You ask me to review the arguments though you yourself demonstrate in your edits that you have not done this talkcon Do you even think I care about you as an individual being offended when you do not care about several others being offended by the FRADULENT information posted by your website My words could be offending to you in your understanding but for me it is the TRUTH And for Mr Gren you are the one who is falsely accusing and forcing your own idealogies of images are not allowed in Islam to others If anyone needs to be labelled as sock puppet it would be you And dear friends don t even bother to post a reply because guess what I have left the building and I am not interested in continuing dialogue because I don t see any fairness from your side There is a saying that You can t straighten a dog s tail by putting in a hose pipe and that perfectly applies to you because no matter how much reasoning and arguments are presented you would have your own preconceived ideas Thank you and come again I couldn t agree more It is apparent that User Hojimacho has a closed mind and no matter how many arguments are presented to him he will stick to his opinions out of shear stubborness and ignorance Thanks,0.5361499,0.013791214,0.0036421155,0.00076364516,0.0024013573

0,Why have you changed the image again The text is now all but unreadable It is now forced into single word lines extending down past the reference section It looks ridiculous You quoted IMGSIZE yet again in the summary That policy states In general do not use px without very good reason What that means is the policy needs not to be unilaterally enforced at all costs If as in this instance there is a need for a change in size it is permissible The policy further states Where px is used the resulting image should be no more than 500 pixels tall and no more than 400 pixels wide for comfortable display on the smallest devices in common use I have already and repeatedly demonstrated that upsizing to 250px is all that required I bet even 220px would work That is well within the limits The change to the picture itself is negligible and therefore does not impact the article negatively in any way It only servers to benefit the article by making the text within the caption more wieldy and easier to read It also eliminates the impact of needlessly extending the picture frame all the way down to the refs Surely you can see this Since you re quoting this policy so much surely you know that it does not prohibit this edit I have asked repeatedly that you look at the effect on the article both before and after the edit and in doing so surely you see the need for this edit Yet you insist on repeatedly reverting which only serves a detriment to the article and is tantamount to vandalism Is that really want you want for this article,0.041498665,0.09357502,0.0024143092,0.0005845819,0.0016589202

0,Letter to User Zoe The world of Wikipedia is not what it should be and would be if people would not INITIATE personal attacks while correcting possible or actual violations of The Five Pillars of Wikipedia The first round of Word Wars against me began all because I dared write about myself an article Sure call it self promotion but self aggrandizement it is not I was not fully aware of the rules then but the fact is that there are people not unlike myself who are worthy of mention on Wikipedia have sufficient write ups press coverage throughout the years or were a significant phenomena at a time but who a cannot afford to hire PR and Publicity firms to have someone write about them on Wikipedia or b would not impose upon their prominent friends to do so Wikipedia should have a Special Cases Department just as government should were certain exceptional individuals can have their day in Wiki Court and have a determination made by a Wiki Jury as to whether or not they deserve a mention in Wikipedia In any case Alec Wilkinson of New Yorker magazine fame intends on writing an article about me for Wikipedia partly out of fairness since there is mention of Amy Alkon and her two partners in plagiarism Amy Alkon Advice Goddess was one of the Three Free Advice Ladies They read my write up in The New Yorker and attempted to become famous at my expense Until that time my life as The Free Advice Man was quite fulfilling and I managed to help many people including some on the verge of suicide You may want to visit www infinitysociety org FREEADVICEMAN html to get the full story Why does this matter Because while it is true that I may have violated Wiki Rules in the past which I no longer seek to do as of Tom Harrison s warning Wikipedia could benefit from an eccentric contributor Yes I was and I am very angry to find that there are Wikipedians who will make unscientific statements about another person s intellectual accomplishments and worth Yes it is likely that there are people who go too far in enforcing the NO ORIGINAL CONTENT pillar I am astounded that no one ever cared then neither User Trovatore User MikeTwo or any of the current Wikipedians involved in this case or now to make a sincere effort to contact Prof Miklos Hernadi at The Hungarian Academy of Sciences who will verify my status as a philosopher and who is aware of media reports in Hungary about my life as a philosopher from 1994 to 2002 including a published book of mine for which he wrote a Peer Review he has a Ph D And should Alec Wilkinson submit an article about me there should be no reason for it to be deleted Look I am 42 years of age and more European than American Maybe Wikipedia is age blind but people who are younger and perhaps less accomplished in life should take the other person s age into consideration and communicate in a respectful and polite manner If you analyze the whole matter and if you are seriously interested in objectivity and making the world a better place then you may yet come to the understanding that I never initiated any attacks even though I did overreact at times Also about anti Semitism When someone attacks me who really does not know me my life s story and the reasons why the media has covered me and dares claim that I am practically a nobody then my reactions are perfectly understandable and given that the strong appearance of malice exists why should I as a Jew not conclude especially about persons who openly admit strong Christian identities with Christian groups that have a known track record for being anti Jewish Maybe CRCulver is not aware of his hate for the concept of infinity which is my specialty and to which I profess my intellectual support for Maybe he is not an anti Semite but he sure did not communicate to me right from the beginning as one would normally expect As for promoting certain views and ideas most Wikipedians and people working on Wikipedia do this all the time Some more subtly than others Anyway you ve blocked me indefinitely Who benefits Look I never went around looking to insult Wikipedians over their violations or mistakes I never deleted information because I think that there should be people in Wikipedia assigned for that sort of thing and those should not be the same as those who add information in fact come to think of it that is a great idea People who do the verifying of facts should not be those who write them separation of Wikipowers Anyway adding an article titled Infinitology is not violating the NO ORIGINAL CONTENT pillar because nowhere in that article did I talk about my name or my identity other than being the author and in fact talked about such prominent individuals living and deceased as Philip K Dick Isaac Asimov Carl Sagan Giordano Bruno Baruch Spinoza etc Anyway,0.018818825,0.063594095,0.0024784543,0.0005785782,0.0020774533

0,Amanda Knox herself stated in her own testimony that she had showered in the bathroom with the bloodstains which also contained the faeces from Guede as she also has said that she thought the bloodstains must have come from one of the female residents of the apartment having their period As for the suggestion that the extensive forensic evidence of cleaning in the apartment is based on the fresh scent of warm soap etc the police used Luminol to uncover bloodstains and bloody footprints in various parts of the apartment that had been cleaned away and were no longer visible to the naked eye I m sure it is not your intention to spread misinformation about the trial by using this discussion page for that purpose now that the main page has been partially locked but the net effect may be the same if you continue to enter statements in the discussion which are not based on the established facts of the case Please bear in mind that the existence of the bloody footprints that had been cleaned away are not disputed by the defence but the identity of the footprints was disputed Therefore we may fairly presume that at least some parts of the apartment had been cleaned so that blood was no longer visible to the naked eye,0.013542287,0.020801267,0.0043912106,0.0005796427,0.0026650208

0,Some Issues which I m about to attempt to partially fix 1 The gold leaf and quadrant electrometers are in a sense also repulsion electrometers they both work by measuring the repulsion of the same charge in one way or another 2 My 1861 chem textbook uses the name quadrant electrometer to describe a considerably simpler device than Kelvin invented This device has an index which goes between 0 and 90 degrees hence a quadrant while Kelvin s device while I don t fully understand it had a drum split into quadrants So I conclude that this is a coincidence The best solution I can think of is to create a section of repulsion electrometers and then describe the types individually in their own sections underneath e g gold leaf Dellmann Peltier Bohnenberger I will rename quadrant electrometer to Kelvin s quadrant electrometer and then put both his and the simpler one under repulsion electrometers Hopefully we can make this article clearer and neater,0.10500678,0.026213532,0.0021529305,0.0005761363,0.0025688135

0,The following is not a formal request to be unblocked Thank you AnthonyBradbury your comments made sense The issues I raised relate to the ANI thread still remaining open Both Erpert NEEnt and now you as an administrator have said that the matter is closed Despite me being blocked 5 days ago and despite Erpert closing the thread and stating no further comments another editor whatamidoing removed that and continued making false baseless claims quoting inaccurate details that easily be proved Further entirely separate matters to what my block was for are now being discussed after I was blocked Without me having an opportunity to present clear contrary evidence based purely on the objective editing history And have a fair minded neutral and independent administrator to judge both sides These editors knew there was a ANI thread but did not comment for 2 days until I was blocked After I was blocked they then and only then stuck the boot in without any facts to back up their false claims They may have waited until I was blocked because these baselss claims would have been proven false immediately through me providing diffs and objective facts to the contrary In fact they only ceased when I asked for a temporary unblock above to respond They would have kept hammering away with baseless false claims providing no facts to back them up and all the while me being unable to provide the facts I have made some very solid edits to numerous articles I respect Wikipedia I respect Wikipedia s policies I accept the reasons for my current block and would appreciate after such a significant period ie 2 full weeks to start afresh and be provided an assumption of good faith in my editing rather than editors judging me already I think all editors after being blocked should be given the benefit of the doubt Not to have this thrown in their face for ever more That s not right I know a lot about some topics Very little about other topics My reliable sources have good My editing and additions have been good Productive in many different articles I completely reject being incompetent as whatamidoing states without me being able to respond Simply because of differing points of view I understand whatamidoing and Bilby are very experienced editors who have made great contributions to Wikipedia as editors No one is disputing that They obviously gain a great deal of enjoyment from the project too Does that provide these editors unequal rights over less experienced editors who are also adding value to the project Where they can make false baseless assumptions I realise I have had some previous conflict with the same small group of editors in the past But that says nothing about my edits being productive and of benefit to the project I believe strongly in the principles of assuming good faith amongst editors I did not think blocks were punitive whereby other editors can mock the person who has been blocked Nor are blocks an opportunity to make false entirely baseless assumptions about an editor s competence Is the ANI thread closed or is it not closed please AnthonyBradbury I am hesitant to ask this through a formal request unblocking request So could an administrator tell me if this ANI thread that was abruptly re opened by whatamidoing after the block was already applied and the thread closed,0.021461451,0.0063080546,0.0005984802,0.00056751387,0.0013500307

0,Free Software Open Source In many articles you show your intention to use the phrase free and open source The best way to deal with this is to choose the term used by the developers of the programs in question themselves If you are working on a page about a program where the developers explicitly use that term I have no objection If the developers use free software it is best to use exactly that for that specific program If the developers of a certain program use only open source and the license of the program is indeed an open source license Excluding the GNU GPL Its text explicitly uses the term free software then it s ok to use that description The purpose is that the reader should not understand the word free to mean gratis in this case Unfortunately just using free alone makes it more likely that people will understand gratis If you software into that phrase free and open source something like open source and free software it would be better,0.014535907,0.007846002,0.0010674415,0.0005735163,0.0012082637

0,I have no problem with the Boeing report but its conclusion is for tether lengths that are much longer than the ones that are being discussed in this article This is where your lack of knowledge about engineering is a problem The mass of a space tether goes up with length Assuming it could take the thermal environment you can build a space tether out of kite string But there is a limit on how long this space tether could be made based on the strength to weight ratio of the string This is where designers start making tapered lines that have more cross sectional area in the middle than at the ends Even with this there are still limits on the length based on cost and total mass You can make an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator using kite string but it will be larger than the Earth hence not practical That doesn t mean that you still can t use that kite string to fly a kite obviously you can The difference is in the length The space elevator is 100 000 km long Your kite string is only a few hundred feet at most The same applies to skyhooks You could build a 100 000 km long space elevator out of T1000GB carbon fibers but it would have near planetary mass and as a result isn t practical But like the much shorter kite string for flying a kite a skyhook made of carbon fibers in the 200 km to 4 000 km range is possible As to the references not all being open source on the internet there is not much I can do about that You will need to either pay for them or go to a university library that pays for access to them and have them downloaded References 7 18 and 19 are open source Reference 19 is only for the part of that paper that covers non rotating skyhooks and does not include the entire paper If you want to see the entire paper do a search using the title on google it is open source Quite simply the information is out there but you will have to do a little digging or pay for it You will also need a basic understanding of engineering and orbital mechanics in regards to space tethers For that I recommend the Tether in Space Handbook it is also open source on the internet see reference 7 You could also just read the abstracts for the non open source papers and you will get an idea that this is a workable concept Or you could just notice who is writing these reports NASA reference 19 Lockheed Martin references 5 8 9 and 10 and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory reference 7 Do you really think these organizations would be wasting their time and money on a lie To conclude with the Boeing report The Boeing report says 1 His analysis showed that because a hanging tether must be tapered to support its lower end in the gravitational field of the Earth achieving a HyperSkyhook tether tip rendezvous with a 5 0 km s 16 kft s or Mach 16 airplane would require a HyperSkyhook tether mass of 25 times the payload mass 5 0 km s is 64 of low Earth orbit velocity A tether mass of 25 times payload mass can be built I have no argument with this 2 Trying to lower the tether tip speed to 4 0 km s 13 kft s or Mach 13 would require a HyperSkyhook tether mass greater than 200 times the payload mass 4 0 km s is 51 of low Earth orbit velocity A tether mass of 200 times payload mass sounds about right and it is highly unlikely that such a tether length would be economic Again no disagreement The tether tip speeds for the non rotating skyhook examples in this article and in all the references I have listed start at 96 of low Earth orbit velocity and go to approximately 70 of low Earth orbit velocity There is no reason to go any lower As a result the final line of the Boeing quote In general the non spinning tether HyperSkyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts does not apply for two reasons 1 It doesn t apply to the skyhook lengths in the article and 2 it is an unfounded over generalization that falls under the category of sales BS that is promoting rotating skyhooks Do you now understand how the Boeing quote that you are so fond of does not apply to the non rotating skyhooks in this article PS The reference numbers are for the article as I have written it Since you keep deleting references with your changes the reference numbers keep changing hence you will need to use the article as I have written it if you want the reference numbers quoted here to mean anything So please read this until you understand it and do your research to confirm what I and many others are saying If you run into any problems that you cannot resolve easily write me here and I will do what I can to assist you,0.03554896,0.042298198,0.0013969284,0.0005724028,0.0014696695

0,Hey Acuman I have read your previous claims and you don t have any clue what you are talking about yet you insist on pressing your personal opinions Ahmadinejad consistently refers to the Zionists and NOT Israel Also phrases like Israel should be WIPED OFF THE MAP are inventions of Zionist controlled Western media Ahmadinejad never said that phrase and what he was referring to which was actually a statement of Ayatollah Khomeini roughly translates to the usurping regime of Israel should be eliminated from the page of the world one could argue that a good translation for that phrase in English would be wiped off the map but that is not what Khomeni had originally said Nonetheless Ahmadinejad was referring to what Khomeini had said and the Western media in my opinion Zionist controlled Western media suddenly blew it way out of proportion for obvious reasons The history of this article clearly shows that it has been obssessively manipulated by a disproportionate number of Zionists their edit history shows they are Zionists Anonymous Iranian who used to oppose the Islamic regime in Iran but is now 100 supportive of them,0.025997657,0.046764575,0.014115199,0.01937661,0.0028643573

0,This page needs to be edited down to a handful of sentences and then merged with Nose if not altogether deleted due to the fact that it is merely a slang term with denotions of eugenics and discredited pseudosciences such as phrenology The author s included a long paragraph by a discredited 19th century scientist named Samual George Morton of which only five words the nose large and aquiline pertain to the article itself As Wikipedia s own article on Morton says and as most medical science students are taught Samuel George Morton is often thought of as the originator of American School ethnography a school of thought in antebellum American science that claimed the difference between humans was one of species rather than variety and is generally seen as the origin of scientific racism The paragraphs in this article are drawn out to unnecessary lengths so as to provide the appearance of substance particularly the Buddhism one which uses 53 words to say that statues of Buddha should have long noses No reference is given So called hooknose snakes have upturned noses not downturned noses as raptors do thus meaning they don t even have hooknoses as the author of this article describes thus making their inclusion truly puzzling I use quotation marks because neither snakes nor birds even have noses in the sense of the ones humans primates have Snakes smell by using their tongues and the Vomeronasal organ inside their mouths a snake s nostril holes are used only for breathing Some venomous types use their additional larger nostrils actually glands called pits to sense heat not odors The fact that such noteworthy intellectuals as Ashlee Simpson and Paris Hilton have recently had rhinoplasties does not even mean that they had or have so called hooknoses Nor does the fact that a fictitious half man half ungulate creature living under a bridge in Kentucky supposedly has one though Wiki s article on it makes no mention of a hooknose nor has it of course ever been photographed It bears pointing out that factors allowing the genetic merging of ungulate and human DNA apparently intrigue the pseudoscience oriented author s of this hooknose article Overall no tangible factors make the term hooknose worthy of its own entry in a fact based 21st century encyclopedia other than as a disambiguation page redirecting to an entry such as Pseudoscience This is a textbook example of an unneccessary article manufactured out of several disparate and unrelated sources by using a smoke and mirrors technique Why not just merge it into Nose and let real scientists doctors hash it out rather than secluding it in its own peripheral entry based on pop culture hearsay non science Hooknoses are an I know it when I see it type of thing with no set way of being measured If it were quantifiable by a certain mathematical formula then it would possibly qualify for inclusion here For example if a nose is downturned by an angle of precicely x degrees or more in relation to its main slope But no such formula exists It is a purely arbitrary colloquial term with a different definition to everyone For example everyone has a different definition of fat but there is a medical definition of obesity calculated using a Body mass index formula There is no such formula for noses Additionally the link given to www newadvent org cathen 12620b htm does not count as a reliable source as it is a religious non scientific organization making dubious and unreferenced claims For the record I am white agnostic and have a small to medium nose with no hook I was attacked and called a vandal by user after flagging this page for deletion and thus I felt it necessary to respond,0.4926989,0.03237162,0.06626843,0.0006709186,0.0020632707

0,If external links are so bad why even allow any links Why not just remove them all No we should NOT be linking to every Chinese astrology site from Wikipedia We all knows the SPAM policies Isn t this what all SPAM police and all user responsibility to weed thourgh the links Use a little common sense when using the linkfarms suggestion When there 10 new spam entries per day and the links are hugh linkfarm suggestion may make sense When there are only a few links 10 and there are no frequent new spam insertion in the page then consider just remove that particular spam that appear instead of removing all the links that have been around for year You made a mistake admit it then recover your mistake Do not cover your back with commonly supported excuse Also instead of wasting my time proving all the links to the article s talk page why don t you spend sometime instead proving to all of us that this site has such a HIGH SPAM activity that it warrant you using the linkfarms method Question about why you deleted my link I posted a link to www justiceforkevin org a non profit site with valuable information about a man who was wrongfully convicted of rape You deleted my edit saying I was a spammer I respectfully disagree this website would have saved Kevin s life if he had had the information it contains and the makers of the site are dedicated to preventing this tragedy from happening to anyone else It should be available for Wikipedia readers interested in these lagal issues So how do I go about putting it back up and maybe getting you to come down off of your high horse The preceding unsigned comment was added by 71 138 56 209 see Special Contributions 68 101 131 133 First off don t add the same link to over 15 pages in 22 minutes That looks really bad Second Wikipedia is not a collection of external links while he may have been subject to Megan s law there are many such people and a link to every save so and so page would dwarf the article Finally stay civil insulting people is likely to make them more hostile to you talk to me OK that s all well and good but it s still within the Wikipedia rules What does it matter how fast they were added or that if EVERYONE did it what would happen I never insulted anyone but you sure seem to have taken this all to your head with deciding who should be included in these articles and who shouldn t And if you are sensitive about people being rude to you why delete their contributions Are you doing it out of your hostile anger or is it an actual appreciation for the rules Seems like the former based on your response Again this link is a perfectly acceptable addition to the sites it was posted on both because of subject matter and pursuant to Wikipedia rules I am going to repost them and if they get deleted again because of your opinion then I ll report it to Wikipedia myself The preceding unsigned comment was added by talk contribs Get off your high horse seems like an insult to me And I m not sensitive at all I ve been called far worse things without batting an eye I just don t like it is all and people have easily been blocked for doing similar things before Besides I m being anything but hostile right now I m trying to work this out with you And if you repost I will block you again If you want to complain about me you can do it at the administrator s noticeboard or request a 3rd opinion or go to the mediation cabal or bring it up on the talk page for the Wikipedia counterspam effort this is probably the closest thing to reporting it to Wikipedia And the external link guidelines say that links whose subject is not directly related There are many people who other people believe were wrongfully convicted of rape why is this man and not John Doe special talk to me Oooh so THAT s what it s about I have to prove to you that something is special and get you to approve it first This is a public website and you re being way too controlling with this The external link I added conformed to the subject matter and to every Wikipedia rule but you seem to not get that I m within Wikipedia,0.42543924,0.035520934,0.01046045,0.00095773593,0.0034440868

0,Hello you seem to be quite wise in this department Is there something like the copyleft thing or full blown copyright with usage rights that I could use instead For now I ve switched the wording to please instead of you must by the way thanks for all your work in this department 8800 speak Wikipedia requires that user created images be under a free license one that permits unrestricted reproduction and modification However there is a way around this If you want to restrict who can use your images your best bet is to license them under the GFDL with an offer to let people use them under other license terms if they ask The GFDL is a very awkward license for images It was designed around the needs of the emacs user manual and requires that the full text of the license be included anywhere that material under the license is published and that any work containing GFDL material be licensed under the GFDL This isn t a problem for things as large as websites and books but it s not practical for smaller things such as posters and magazine articles and for profit companies usually don t want to publish their work under anything but simple copyright So by licensing under the GFDL you let the images be used on Wikipedia and related projects such as Wikibooks or Wikipedia Commons on Wikipedia re users such as Answers com and on other GFDL licensed websites At the same time you make it difficult to use the image in printed works and in commercial projects giving you some control over who re uses your images Suggested wording for your template This photograph is the work of xvisionx com Permission is granted to copy distribute and or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License Version 1 2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation with no Invariant Sections no Front Cover Texts and no Back Cover TextsSubject to disclaimers If you want to use this image under other license terms contact me and we can work something out,0.7124617,0.05880489,0.0004250282,0.00057320535,0.0017112984

0,Working It Out Tour 2010 2011 The Working it out Tour started in 2010 with Traci K Shoop taking it to the next level of fitness By adding music with muscle and modeling She presented herself through the east coast and some west promoting health and music Presented in part for association FPLA to raise money helping with her in transition and team artists and athletes become members to showcase to be promoted Traci s music was a hit on her teaser song Kiss me love me with holiday added starting in December featuring her very first christmas album Tis the Season to be Sexy This album earned her credentials for a peoples choice nomination where voted amongst some of the top pop artists like Susan Doyle and Mariah Carey In this tour she went around presenting a way to help with hard times by giving back to support her coming back out from supporting the troops It landed her even top awards with Karaoke social networks When making the top charts in with her Be My Santa BAby it inspired her to bring out for the tour for kisses with the United States Entertainment organization with the service members With allowing her to get a chance to mission to meet and greet soldiers during the war time to give morale and become a long distance pen pal She herself committed 14 years as a spouse and served under contract training soldiers and families during the times when most effected by stress and abandonment Traci s goal as an artist and pro athlete was to bring as many people on the team to help with promoting them during transitional times asking other non service artists who were working to try and contribute financially or through contributions But to also honor the ones who like her served not under combat but through missions and it earned her loyality pin coins and awards with national congressional committes Where she placed on the board The true inspiration to push to try and break from the low income of serving and being honored and recognized truly with demanding to be heard This tour was of course a struggle with many of the financial reasons and not allowing to spread the truth of what really goes on and how it effects families The way some are not truly appreciated on both ends when helping while others in the entertainment receive huge amounts of money and media exposure with little to ever be left for the ones who also work for their freedom To also showcase true health and fitness through the arts and science of things Which actually helped land her first emmy nomination in two categories in 2010 And also nominations with the carolina music awards and the independent music awards,0.0022478825,0.049770065,0.0021255154,0.0006310083,0.001833348

0,It seems heavily slanted in favor of Greenpeace For example the article states that they activists attempted to board but not trespassed Certain pharmaceutical drugs are kept in a safe The Russian authorities broke the safe after they took the vessel 36 Sounds like it was written by GP Relies on a GP source Two activists managed to attach themselves to the platform and attempted to climb despite being blasted with water whilst another activist was unable to attach themself to the platform Aside from the poor style the poor construction and the awkward attempt to make it gender neutral it reads like the person that wrote the sentence wants the reader to cheer for the GP activists What does it mean to attach oneself to a platform Russian authorities forcibly took control of the Arctic Sunrise which was boarded from a helicopter by fifteen Federal Security Service officers in balaclavas armed with guns and knives Is it unusual that the Federal Service would wear balaclavas or arm themselves with guns and knives Given the task that they were performing such a uniform seems routine At the time of the boarding the Arctic Sunrise was in Russia s EEZ but not within the safety zone around the oil rig and permission was not sought to board it from the Arctic Sunrise s flag state the Netherlands Does Russia need permission from NL to board a ship that is clearly dedicated to enabling activists to trespass on a Russian oil rig It s implied If it s true it should be noted If not it should be removed It is alleged that crew members and activists were punched and kicked during the forced boarding Alleged by whom Why were they punched and kicked Were the guards using more than the necessary amount of force to subdue non cooperative and or combative arrestees The use of the monicker Arctic 30 implies a sympathetic viewpoint Just because certain media have used the term doesn t mean that WP should also Just because certain media organizations are sympathetic doesn t mean WP should be also It becomes a biased article when it uses such monickers that are intended to create sympathy for those arrested Nearly the entire Responses section is irrelevant except for the responses and requests from the Gov t of NL Seriously does anyone really consider it WP worthy that a reporter wrote something on Facebook The Greenpeace Announcements section seems like a thinly veiled medium for advocating GP s position Perhaps a Russian Government Announcements would balance the article a bit but the idea of such a section seems silly International Reaction section Again seems like a thinly veiled medium for listing anyone and any no one that supports GP I don t see the relevance Additionally how is this section different from the Responses section,0.028799754,0.066113286,0.0027058236,0.0005920096,0.0021153733

0,There are still many fundamental problems with the string theory and its successors M theory etc I mention just three problems which a good Theory of Everything TOE should solve 1 A good TOE should be able to formulate its own principles and fundamental equations Moreover these principles and equations should clarify and simplify our picture of the physical world and allow some testable predictions As far as I know nothing like that is still available for the string theory M theory in contrast to its rather long development and far reaching claims 2 A good TOE should allow calculations of all interaction constants and particle parameters from its fundamental principles It was actually one of the original Einstein s goals to give some purely geometrical or mathematical origin to fundamental physical constants No variant of string theory is able to calculate these parameters from some first principles 3 If the TOE is formulated in some space of higher dimension 11 etc as expected there should be also a unique and justified principle of compactification e g a principle how to project the structures from the 11 dim world to our tangible 4 dim world In its contemporary status super string theory is very fuzzy and umbiguous concerning the compactification In my opinion the very word theory is rather premature in connection with the super string theory and Einstein himself probably would not be very happy with its present form and claims,0.004998199,0.018330771,0.0042367084,0.0005729639,0.0015004864

0,Here is the summary I agree that wikipedia articles may have pictures and it is preferable to show them for the convenience of the reader The pictures of Jesus Mary etc are very commonly depicted in the churches and other places so whenever there is article to explain about Jesus and christianity then it is much preferable to give the abstract idea to the user about how Christianity looks like and what is associated with it including the pictures of Jesus and Mary Now agreeing to the this the problem is that there are no images associated to Muhammad or other Prophets in Muslims as well as Mosques and any other places So when a reader will come to know about Isamic articles then he will be given the idea of how Islam looks like and what is associated to Isalm and Muhammad including Islamic calligraphy Now if there does not exist and prominent association about Muhammad s picture then it is NOT necessary to somehow bring Any insignificant picture no matter it is drawn by some 12 year old kid or some very unpopular artist who is not only unknown in the nonIslamic world but Muslims too So when a Muslim comes to the article about Muhammad he will just feel strange on the rediculous depiction and might even laugh that I did nt know there is such picture used about Islam Imagine the misery of a wikipedia article in where the follower of the religion himself has to laugh at what is being shown as a fact about his religion I hope my comments look valid at the same time when I agree about the value of an image where it is actually represending the article and not contradicting it,0.047310904,0.0044767153,0.0016013243,0.00057458464,0.001451829

0,I am sorry to say Mr Tosa was not invited to that championship So what you are telling is not true Sensei Shukumine never had any contact with Tosa after Tosa turned his back on him and started his own commercial Karate organization Please see also Sensei Shukumine s personal message at a training seminar in The Netherlands with Sensei Kanai and Sensei Konno Please see the pictures on the Genseiryu website Taido and Genseiryu people united to celebrate 55 years Genseiryu 40 years Taido and to commemorate Sensei Shukumine Besides that there are pictures of Sensei Shukumine teaching several Genseiryu Teachers like Genseiryu Head Instructor Sensei Kanai in Genseiryu Head dojo situated in Ito Japan in 1996 212 127 137 2 19 37 5 Jun 2005 UTC Were you at the championship or something So if Mr Tosa never had any contact with Mr Shukumine after 1962 then please explain these picturse of Mr Tosa and Mr Shukumine together on the Brazilian Genseiryu website Zzaroc 22 01 5 Jun 2005 UTC I am sorry I didn t say Sensei Shukumine had any contact after 1962 I said he didn t had any contact after Sensei Tosa turned his back to Sensei Shukumine This was after Sensei Shukumine wrote the preface for sensei Tosa s book about Genseiryu Butokukai And yes I was present at the championship in Okinawa amongst other Genseiryu practitioners from Spain Denmark Holland and Japan I will try to give also a link with pictures of that event I need a little time for that I am not an Internet black belt sorry for that 212 127 137 2 22 53 5 Jun 2005 UTC You don t have to be a black belt when your good by the way But take your time I am patient But I was wondering Mr Tosa published his book in 1984 but there still a picture of him together with Mr Shukumine in 1985 I mean those pictures on the Brazilian site Then there are still a few questionmarks But by the way did you know that Mr Tosa received several letters all over the world just after Mr Shukumine died Those letters were asked for permission if some dojo s could join the organization of Mr Tosa Mr Tosa denied these people to join his organization There was one person who send such a letter to Mr Tosa from Holland and you may guess who And I have got also another question Mr Seiken Shukumine past away to an hart attack But when did he started to get ill Zzaroc 23 59 5 Jun 2005 UTC No a black belt is not needed to have a certain skill But in most occasion it shows an amount of training effort time And as you probably know training effort makes you become more skillfull I don t know when Mr Tosa turned his back to sensei Shukumine so maybe my remark that they didn t had any contact shouldn t be done by me because I am not aware of that specific date So I apologize for that But I heard this occured in the mid till end 80s No I didn t know that Mr Tosa received several letters from all over the world I know he claimed to get a letter from Holland I know he received one which was delivered by someone from Denmark But I know that the letter was completely different from what is claimed by Mr Tosa That is also easy to believe if you are member of a Genseiryu organization in Ito which was directly connected to sensei Shukumine where Sensei Shukumine still gave in very few occasions lectures about Genseiryu pictures are on the way few days necessary So you can imagine you don t beg for acknowledgement by Mr Tosa who only wants you to train his way which is very near to Shotokan with the basic kata of Shotokan This dojo in Holland is not interested in any connection with Mr Tosa For what reason if you want to train Genseiryu the same way as sensei Shukumine taught his students The Head Instructor of this organization is now Sensei Kanai one of the first students of Sensei Shukumine In Sensei Shukumine s book Shin Karatedo Kyohan there are several pictures of teachers who are still in this group I met them during the celebrating anniversary of Taido and Genseiryu beginning of this year Jan 2005 Many nice teachers who still respect Sensei Shukumine as should be in the relationship with teacher and student I was never involved with the sickness of Sensei Shukumine and I don t like to talk about his sickness I met Mr Shukumine one time and talked a little bit with him In Okinawa I only met him from a distance So I am sorry I can t anwer this question for I didn t have such a close relationship with Sensei Shukumine 212 127 137 2 06 48 6 Jun 2005 UTC I m not in,0.031088382,0.003476793,0.0017631357,0.00062996993,0.0017212059

0,on the Creator The demiurge is an expression of philosophy in that it is a Greek or Hellenistic cultural concept This means that the Demiurge is a cultural concept from the Greeks who did not believe in the empirical existence of nothingness as non substantive ex nihilo They treated nothingness as a substance called aether The Greeks as pagans and pagan philosophers did not believe that you can get nothing from something therefore the creator had to create from something Plato it was the good Aristotle it was energy Plotinus it was force These are ontological noema that create consciousness in humans This arises from the unique essence of Greek or Hellenistic philsophy treating the natural physic and supernatural metaphysic as extensions of human consciousness So everything that can be talked about or experienced stems from human consciousness and therefore must be expressed from a anthropomorphic perspective God or Gods can not be anything outside of human That s why Zeus and the Gods are flawed as their flaws reflect in man and mankinds flaws reflect in them The demiurge as a phrase is creator and nothing can be created but in the way that mankind creates The Greek Orthodox Christian God is not relatiable to the Actus et potentia as the Roman Catholic God since God in essence is not action or inaction or potential nor inpotential this would make God s being essence or substance comprehenisible and that then is not the Ortohodox Christian God The Christian God is not one the monad or unity according to St Dionysus the Areopagite Orthodox Christianity did not have the same God therefore the concept of God uses and has familiar language between Hellenstic Greek and Byzantine Greek but in essence substance is a different concept of God In Greek Orthodox Christianity which Iamblichus kinda tried to graft into Neoplatonism after the fact God is in and outside the Universe God is made up of a substance that is beyond substance since God s consciousness ontologically is hyper being Meaning that God as a substance can not be detected nor contained Now this was dependent on the concept of hypostasis immanence or existence cataphatic The Pagan philosophical God was a detectable substance that all things derive from and reduced to The Orthodox Christian God is a hyper substance that is not empirically detectable Mankind has to be altered in order to detect it Since the God in Greek Orthodox Christianity in his trinitarian completeness uncreatedness does not have the same consciousness as mankind did not share mankinds consciousness until he became a human being AKA Jesus Christ The reverse is only true in Philosophy since in Orthodox Christianity God as a whole has a consciousness which is completely unrelatable to mankind Philosophy God and mankind have the same consciousness and Roman Catholicism and Protestantism treat God ontologically very much as modalistic like Sabellianism which creates also a different consciousness Orthodox Christianity also rejects this as anthropomorphic izing the Christian God which can only come from not actually having experiencing the Christian God theoria and only experiencing the template in your brain or intrinsic God of philosophy,0.12055368,0.045487378,0.047271654,0.00058649055,0.0025038181

0,That Austin Allegro pic I think the pic of a 1979 Austin Allegro is actually a Vanden Plas either 1500 or 1750 model You can tell by the raised grille attached to the bonnet the VP was a luxury sic version of the Allegro mark 2 model produced between 1975 and 1979 It had a classic wood and leather interior including walnut picnic tables recessed into the backs of the front seats and the different frontal treatment you can see hints of in the pic The VP was something of a freak who was it aimed at in marketing terms and did anyone ever associate Allegros with luxury motoring It was probably produced because Ford was having big success with the Ghia versions of some of its models upgraded and laden with extras for which a premium price was charged and cash strapped BL was desperate for some of the action The reason for raising this is that VPs weren t actually badged as Austins or Allegros for that matter but sold as a separate marque albeit through the same BL dealderships so the pic shouldn t appear on the Austin history page cos it isn t Pedantic Big Mike,0.023398759,0.015723445,0.0025790022,0.00058582745,0.0060376045

0,Looking at s immensely helpful and insightful comment particularly the Godwin s Law article I can see the downside of mentioning Nazi even to illustrate a point even when it is not intended as any kind of PA Looking into their and some other people s comments I can also see the benefits of trying to avoid hyperbole and will strive to do so on my own But I see that you know Sitush personally and have a close involvement with him her It seems that you are here only to help Sitush turn these articles into his her personal fiefdom As such I cannot rely on you to interpret further hurtful hyperbole in a neutral balanced fashion and cannot give that undertaking to you I see that this article sphere is being adminned by a small group of mostly involved admins That is not how articles spheres are supposed to be adminned I see this as a failure of Wikipedia adminning process This article sphere is infamous for various problems and I think rather that eds the problem is due to the failure of adminning process whereby articles are supposed to be adminned by uninvolved admins rather than a small group of involved admins If some admin is taking continuous interest in one particular area of articles they must be having some kind of involvement interest in the content in that area That is not respectable adminning and will clearly lead to problems as indeed it is here It creates a situation where eds from only one particular orientation will have paramount power on article content and the eds on the other side will get butchered I do not think this article sphere has any problems that do not exist in other article spheres Other admins are being kept away by the continuous propaganda that this sphere is problematic and a small band of involved admins continues to occupy their turf Thanks and everything,0.008033491,0.0062831375,0.0009372299,0.00059311313,0.001603309

0,irrelevant only what the world calls her matters So I checked Google News 2 753 hits for Ashlee Simpson 489 for Ashlee Simpson Wentz I feel this demonstrates that Ashlee Simpson is still the correct title Does anyone oppose moving it back I was going to say the same thing Her legal name is irrelevant this article should be at the most commonly used name that most people know her by which is obviously Ashlee Simpson 92 1 2 237 Yes and even her official website still calls her Ashlee Simpson I will move the page back to Ashlee Simpson in 24 hours unless there is an objection or unless Google News indicates a significant trend toward general adoption of the Simpson Wentz name I searched Ashlee Simpson as Ashlee Simpson Wentz and pages are starting to refer to her as Ashlee Simpson Wentz Let s keep the article as is Preceding unsigned comment added by 24 151 137 19 Yeah I ve searched her as Ashlee Simpson Wentz in Google News and they ve started referring to her as Ashlee Simpson Wentz The article is fine the way that it is You can see the numbers I posted a few days ago above The current numbers are 3 358 for Ashlee Simpson and 559 for Ashlee Simpson Wentz I don t see a trend towards the latter Most of the newest articles refer to her as Ashlee Simpson Considering that she got married a couple weeks ago I think that 559 results as Ashlee Simpson Wentz is a good number of articles It will probably increase as more articles are written If that were the case we d see a trend but what I see is that there was a spike in the use of the new name after it was announced but that subsequently most sources continued to use the old name The results indicate to me that the new name hasn t caught on Read this she s taking Pete s surname and is going by Simpson Wentz professionally I think this settles this dicussion 24 151 137 19 The point is that it doesn t matter what she calls herself Wikipedia articles are titled according to the common name of the subject Exactly Ashlee is changing her common name 24 151 137 19 She can t change her common name Her common name is decided according to what people want to call her If they now start calling her Ashlee Simpson Wentz then that s her new common name but if they keep calling her Ashlee Simpson then that remains her common name That s why I ve been comparing Google News results to see whether this new name is really catching on Also as I pointed out her website still uses her old name but maybe they re just lazy Since there are two of you in favor of keeping it at this title I propose that we wait one week then look at the results again and see if there s more of a shift towards Simpson Wentz I just noticed that Danny has been going around changing the articles on her albums so that they are described as Ashlee Simpson Wentz albums Considering we don t even have a consensus on what she should be called now I don t think it s appropriate to try to extend the Simpson Wentz name to album articles which were released under the Ashlee Simpson name before she married Pete I ve searched Google News for Ashlee Simpson which had 3 162 results and Ashlee Simpson Wentz which had 1 613 results So clearly the results for Ashlee Simpson are dropping while results for Ashlee Simpson Wentz are increasing But as Everyking said he,0.0019924017,0.9370719,0.0024632893,0.00059346826,0.0016863976

0,Semantics of Private vs Independent I think describing Canadian private schools as independent is problematic I think most would agree that there are specific connotations to each word that should be recognized Calling something an independent school has positive connotations of independance nobility etc private carries connotations of exclusion elitism and could be seen as a more negative desciption of these schools I personally think private is the more appropriate term for schools existing outside of the public system requiring yearly tuition in excess of 20 000 I feel terming them independent is white washing their exclusivity and restricted access 24 235 129 212,0.43317363,0.008009129,0.0037063828,0.0005843775,0.0011990246

0,First of all I want to appoligy for my too hasty re inclusion of the content into the article which I by the way only did because of the presumption of having satisfied all fellow editors call for adding a direct reference for the Reference values in the table which previously indeed lacked a reference In the back mirror I was a little too hasty to re instate and should of course instead first have uploaded the content to my sandbox and then asked for the talkpage approval before uploading it again Please however consider that all my actions were only excecuted in good faith Subsequently I was surprised to find a continued resistance about the content from fellow editors here at the talkpage Based on those grounds I of course accept your removal of the content from the article and have just created a for the subsequent debate we shall now still continue to have about the appropriateness which I still claim to include a monthly data table in the article In regards of your claim that my most recent version of the uploaded disputed material is still WP OR I will request you to return with a reply why you think this is so and what we in your opinion need to do in order for the content to satisfy the policy As far as I know we are allowed at Wikipedia to create our own wikitables to display fully referenced data which it indeed was in my latest version of the data table I admit at first to have uploaded unsourced Monthly reference value data that strived against WP OR which was something I only did as part of a process in the hope for other editors or myself at a later stage being able to find direct sources for those values Yesterday I indeed managed to find a direct source for these monthly values published by the Polish Ministry of Finance Please take into consideration that we do not have 2 equal WP PS for the same data but only have 1 The Polish source as I have managed to proof here at the talkpage that the Latvian source do not qualify for the purpose as it did not strictly follow the published official ECB evaluation method which it by the way funny enough also never claimed it did but instead has adopted its own data approach Please also consider that my uploaded data table with monthly data in principle can stand alone even without that we mention the debated report by the Latvian Central Bank as I have prooved here at the talkpage they utilised another data approach than the official ECB method After I now have ellaborated on the details do you then have a different opinion whether or not my most recent version of the uploaded material still shall be classified as WP OR The reason why I think it is so important that we in the Latvian article display monthly convergence values for each month for the past year and why inclusion of this material shall not be disquallified as per WP NOTSTATS is because the uploaded monthly data for the most recent 12 months reflect how the official ECB method works as a graphical illustration which help casual readers to grasp that all candidate countrys have been granted the right by EU to apply ECB for conducting a monthly convergence check at each month during the year if they belief to have met all criteria Unfortunately ECB do not automatically publish monthly convergency reports during the year because in that case we would obviously have used their direct data for the table instead But as I already provided evidense for the Polish Ministry are publishing monthly reports where they check for monthly convergence and calculate the ECB reference value limits based on the official ECB method which proofs this is notable stuff and their findings in the Polish context has also been covered over at the Polish wikipedia although by a much lower quality than my attempt Taking this into consideration will you then still argue it is inappropriate we do the same here at the English wikipedia for the Latvian article in the version showcased by my Personal reply to TDL not related to the article itself In the past four months there have now been a few times where you and I clashed about the WP OR policy In those cases where we have clashed I admit to have applied a backwords approach where I started out to state the facts as I knew it was the WP TRUTH I have always seen such uploads as part of a process where we were continously working to find sources and improve the articles So my uploads were not ment to be unsourced forever but something where it could be possible for me or another editor at a later stage to return and add the needed,0.0062272917,0.009217196,0.0005698876,0.00057686877,0.0017562722
0,Hello there Peter I don t tend watch other users talk pages since my watchlist is already quite stuffed and because some talk pages receive a lot of Non to related traffic that would cause the page to pop up Just a note for the PS section there are multiple ways to post reactions to multiple people Personally i prefer to copy n paste the entire section back and forth between pages since that assures that the conversation is always up to date and readable for everyone Whereas only placing responses on other people s talk pages would lead to a fragmented conversation Other editors prefer other methods some just post a reply on every involved parties talk page Alternatively you can place the Talkback template on another users page to notify them that you left a response for them on your own page Which is convenient in its own rights since you can keep the entire conversation on a single page All methods are really fine in the end it is just a means to make sure that another editor managed to find your reply Contact me Contribs,0.0067612217,0.006094245,0.00057364366,0.0006199385,0.0013304374

0,Actually that means you didn t understand my point My point was that you re proposed deletion was based on a type of bias Everyone is biased even those who edit in good faith I was not saying that you re proposed deletion was in bad faith Far from that What I was saying is that its based on a bias held by most wiki editors and people in general against small media outlets This is problematic because who is to say that a small media outlet such as The Con isn t notable What makes it not notable The fact that its small Or the fact that it isn t mainstream Or the fact that it is South African Notability can be according to one s point of view Obviously you don t think it is notable However I do think it is notable otherwise why would I take the time to create the page in the first place I don t benefit from creating the page so I have no other reason to create it other than my own view that it is in fact notable nevermind the fact that thousands of people already read The Con they ve been republished in a number of places and they have well established an notable well known journalists as regular contributors I therefore move to have the page remain at very least as a stub Frombelow talk,0.038051814,0.004106915,0.0022298554,0.00058850076,0.0014261234

0,Well there s been a lot said if I can just address Kolzene s point first I don t quite understand your suggestion that the article needs to be split into 3 different ones what would these different articles be Firstly let s just overview what is already in place we ve got this article Technocratic movement and the sub articles like Technate etc we ve got Technocracy which is just a disambiguation page Technocracy bureaucratic and Technocrat derogatory Then we have Network of European Technocrats which is part of the broader Technocratic movement So what you re saying is we need a Technocracy Incorporated article specifically about that group detached from the main article in the same way as NET Well I suppose that could be done but remember that that article did already once exist and was then merged with this one What would this article contain if all the Tech Inc stuff were taken out and put in a different article I have to say I think further splitting of the articles will only create an even more confusing array of definitions for readers Perhaps we should think about reformatting the above articles into a more reasonable arrangement The article Technocracy used to be a lot bigger and gave more info on the different groups and definitions of the term but it was recently trimmed down to something very small which I was against doing BTW So to start from the beginning we have the word Technocracy which has acquired many different meanings one meaning being a Bureaucratic oligarchy of Scientists this is addressed in the Technocracy bureaucratic and Technocrat derogatory articles and isn t really relevant here The other meaning the one we are concerned with here is that used by the Technical Alliance and Tech Inc and subsequently adopted by several other groups in 1930 s Then NET which was essentially a direct branching from Tech Inc just in Europe but has adopted it s own ideas some of which are different to Tech Inc s I don t really know what is the best way to proceed yet but I don t think anything should be split or deleted without a lot more discussion,0.74989265,0.751966,0.0053829537,0.000618066,0.0025724042

0,Mr Mosfetfaser I think your block was not appropriate You were asking tough but fair questions and I thank you for it To answer your question about why this resignation happened it is apparently not Floquenbeam s fault There have been strong suggestions from knowledgeable persons that this resignation was forced by former arbitrator who has had trouble letting go of the reins of power as evidenced by her frequent interventions on the ArbCom pages The details are hard to decipher but I am conducting investigations and I can say it is very likely that Risker was involved somehow Be careful not to make accusations before we know all the facts but we must ask questions 2601 7 1980 BF6 5C5B E80D CCA4 5403,0.0044320608,0.0061032786,0.0007513268,0.0005924171,0.0051939124

0,Stats in football players infoboxes Hi When you update the stats in football players infoboxes please remember that you should also update the timestamps as of when the stats are correct This is done by updating or parameter when updating club appearances and goals or or when updating national team appearances and goals This shows when the stats were last updated and prevents editors from accidentally updating the stats again The easiest way to do this is to use five tildes which automatically converts to the current time For example Please keep this in mind Thank you talk,0.0054269223,0.014960944,0.0027409405,0.00057211483,0.0012413214

0,I am sorry to have hurt your religious beliefs Seriously are you asking me to find sources when you have none Are you aware that Wikipedia is not a democracy Refer to WP POLL I do not see the consensus I agree with the oldest surviving monotheistic religion part but I completely disagree with the claim of Judaism being the oldest surviving religion for two reasons 1 There is no scholarly source making this claim apart from some anonymous Jewish child who has uploaded some pdf file on a website that has zero credibility Are you serious I still am shocked to see that you guys are defending an anonymous kid s high school homework paper as a legitimate source of knowledge to be honorably quoted on the Wikipedia 2 Credible sources like Encyclopaedia Britannica are saying that another religion is the oldest surviving religion On the Wikipedia article on Hinduism the exact same claim is made but with reliable sources See WP SOURCES Among its direct roots is the historical Vedic religion of Iron Age India and as such Hinduism is often called the oldest living religion D S Sarma Kenneth W Morgan The Religion of the Hindus 1953 or the oldest living major religion in the world in the world So my question is which page on the Wikipedia is to be trusted in this regard The one with reliable scholarly sources or the one with anonymous self published pdf files I still do not understand why the name of the authors are not given and they are considered scholarly sources Where were these cited works published Where are the references in the works These essays are saying God made a pact with Abraham and so forth How can this be even taken seriously if the article is assuming that all the God pact story is actual historical fact Any way that s the besides the main point The real issues here are reliable sources self published sources verifiability and original research by anonymous teenage prodigal scholars Now let us examine the scholar noel12 from Texas who wrote this high school homework paper On the cited source the said scholar claims to be 15 at the time of writing this scholarly article Do we still need to talk about WP V in this regard The other cited source a music website run by Jewish people does not even have a title or name of the author or date of publication or anything except the bold claim that Judaism is the oldest religion Please do not take this personally or anything I really wish to stress this twice I just like to see Wikipedia as a reliable encyclopedia Is it more about reflecting personal sentiments or providing credible knowledge cited with scholarly sources In summary I say that the uncited claim of Judaism being the oldest surviving religion be removed while keeping the oldest monotheistic religion part and keep Wikipedia a serious unbiased encyclopedia Hope I have appealed to your better judgement 70 64 86 187,0.14506485,0.009286592,0.010580917,0.0006853267,0.003376993

0,The dispute appears to be over the added content A source says civil violation Terjen keeps changing it to civil infraction and it s not at all clear if civil violation is the same thing as civil infraction it s safer to stick to the original wording of the source this civil offense should not be construed to diminish or qualify any other penalties to which an illegal alien may be subject was added with a reference to the Immigration and Naturalization Act section 274D where residing in the US is identified as a civil offense it also adds Nothing in this section shall be construed to diminish or qualify any penalties to which an alien may be subject for activities proscribed by section 243 a or any other section of this Act Terjen appears to believe that the way I summarized that statement constitutes original research I have posted a question in the Wiki Law project to get outsider opinions on whether I properly summarized it or not Terjen continues to put the statement that residing in the US is a civil offense at the top of the paragraph Considering that most illegal immigrants are sojourners not residents this edit makes no sense and I ve put the paragraph s subject sentence Various unlawful immigration related acts depending on the circumstances may be criminal and or civil offenses at the beginning Terjen edited the word crime to misdemeaner but provided no source for doing so I reverted it 66 194 62 5,0.31761953,0.11314152,0.010967777,0.00057008467,0.0013347092

0,First off Miles and Blume came to the same conclusion and Blume said he did interviews so I m assuming Miles didn t pull his statements out of his behind and actually talked to some residents about the riots That would be the logical conclusion since he s one of the few in Lhasa for the riots so why would he just hang around making assumptions about what they were complaining about without any evidence whatsoever Even if Miles didn t interview anybody Blume still did and he still came to the same conclusions so your point is absolutely moot Your criticism is REALLY getting ridiculous here Miles already says what the primary reason is ethnic hatred and one must assume that he had to talk to people in Lhasa to find out why otherwise he would ve made the same conclusion that you and many other misinformed do that the riots were for nationalism independence The fact that the rumours of monks getting killed angered the residents and helped start the riots is already mentioned in the article Not to mention that I ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT POINT OF YOURS So what if monks getting killed is part of the reason why riots started Does that point to nationalism or does that point to the same type of anger you or I would feel if we saw nuns getting shot by the police I already addressed your proof of nationalism by the Chinese flag being trampled You are free to actually read what I say And someone who attributes flag burning and pro tibet slogans as proof that the riots were not because of ethnic hatred but because of nationalism and implying that the cause of the riots were for independence autonomy has no right to criticize how the current article is written Your own proof is 100 presumptuous while the argument I make is actually from what the Tibetans have reportedly said Until you actually find that someone in Lhasa being interviewed complaining about wanting independence or autonomy or any evidence that the Tibetans rioted out of nationalism besides your own presumptuous interpretations then I advise you to drop the issue because you seem downright biased and unreasonable right now Sorry to say but the evidence is stacked against your view Last no one said it was all about the rising prices If you read the article it clearly states that the riots occurred for several reasons of which only one was inflation So basically YOU ARE JUST SPECULATING You cannot just include your own personal opinions and interpretations into the article The fact is that the reporters who were there actually described what the residents were complaining about and at the very least offered their professional interpretation of what the riots were about James Miles which is supported by their interviews with the residents of what they were complaining about 216 252 71 154,0.024318919,0.018874776,0.0010949612,0.0010972448,0.0016077475

0,The Ottoman census reflects only the religuious adherence of the population and nothing else Exactly So what makes you think that using religion as the primary criterion of nationality is not the closest thing to the truth Maybe it is and maybe it isn t but neither you nor me are in position to decide that This is why in my version all criteria used in the demographies are explained in detail without deciding which is right and which is wrong and that my friend is what we call neutrality You might as well try and take a hint Nothing from the Turkish cencus proves nor implies that those Greeks were not Greek speaking The majority of Bulgarian population had never been adherent to the Patriarch of Constantinople You re confusing yourself with the small Bulgarian or Slavic speaking population which viewed itself as part of the Roman nation which had lost its mother tongue over time Therefore despite religion and language the greater part of the population of Southern Macedonia viewed itself as Greek or Roman if you prefer Then if we can t trust any demography think of the population exchanges 50 000 Greeks entered Greek Macedonia from Pirin Macedonia and some 60 000 Bulgarians left for Bulgaria Then some 500 000 Greeks enter from Turkey and suddenly we have some 1 million Greeks in Greek Macedonia Where did the other half million come from Mars Oh I know it s a Bulgarian majority group that the Greek government is still hiding isn t that so And now think of the ludicrous numbers that you re trying to pass as the truth 2 million Bulgars in the entire of Macedonia and the assumption of another million in the south I mean use your brain for ones and do the maths have you ever checked what the population of Bulgaria is today Honestly some people just can t take the truth And if neither of that convinces you then think of the Greco Serbian alliance Would the Serbs have ever agreed with Greece occupying over half of Macedonia for itself unless that land was not primarily Greek Serbia was significantly stronger than Greece and in the search of Slavic speaking lands to assimilate It would have never happened If you really want to do something to help your country I would advise you to go over there and offer your people some physical help I don t think that making nationalist propaganda of the internet is one of their priorities at the moment,0.44747272,0.009299239,0.0068630534,0.0006006875,0.0027328895

0,I can t tell you any such thing What meets criterion a doesn t meet b Apparently no one else has anything to support the current language either Walter Nissen talk 2010 07 19 20 41 There is another source for Tavernor on his derivation of plus or minus and why he chose Smoot s Ear for his title This is an account by Marie Y Thibault of Tavernor s speech at MIT about his book with Smoot in attendance Both his Preface and his speech have similar structures concerning Smoot s Ear and plus or minus Both appear to be explanations of his choice of title Both open with 1 ear It s presented by Tavernor as the historical basis i e the historical measurement as shown by the 1987 plaque and the decades of paint on the bridge Both derive plus or minus from 1 ear Neither states that the historical measurement was plus or minus Thibault gives a direct quote from Tavernor The significance of Smoot s Ear is that is stands for an approximation a plus or minus Smoot s Ear is a component of the historical measurement 1 ear stands for is clearly not an historical recounting but a reference to Tavernor s interpretation He s distinguishing the earlier Ear from his contribution plus or minus If plus or minus were already part of the historical record it wouldn t be necessary or desirable to begin with 1 ear Plus or minus was not part of the historical record it was introduced for purposes of this discussion by Tavernor as his interpretation not part of the historical record Tavernor s account in the Thibault article is clearer on some of these points than the Preface but both seem to achieve the same basic end explaining how the ear in 1 ear from the measurement on the bridge leads to the ideas in the book beginning with plus or minus i e uncertainty Tavernor isn t trying to say that his treatment was on the bridge nor measured on the bridge quite the contrary that he took this human measurement with a component obviously intended to provoke inter alia the notion of uncertainty and related it to the whole history of measurement and made a book of it It doesn t matter how many times Tavernor says the bridge measures 364 4 Smoots plus minus an Ear He could say it 300 times He might even say the length of the bridge is 360 Smoots plus or minus an ear That has its own truth These are only a couple of simple derivative forms out of a host of possible derivative forms From what are they derived Tavernor tells us He begins his Preface and book and speech on this subject with the historical measurement 364 4 smoots 1 ear Tavernor s first reference citation within his book for the Preface which certainly seems to be the one he considers most important is to what he calls a corroborating interview storyId 5043041 That s the one I quoted earlier 2005 12 07 Now how long is the Harvard Bridge if it s measured in smoots Mr SMOOT himself Three hundred and sixty four point four plus one ear It d be pretty incongruous to argue that he found plus or minus there Also he repeatedly cites WP which at the time didn t have plus or minus Contrary to my initial thoughts when his Preface was being put forward to re write history that he was not well situated to know about this he does make it clear that he carefully checked into the bridge He is a distinguished scholar and an architect who happens to be in a Dept of Sociology who wrote a book that seems to be a good read Tavernor s Preface was cited on the morning of New Year s Day 2008 as support for the edit of Smoot to add but the Preface actually refutes the edit by its reference to 1 ear didn t arise on the bridge it showed up in Tavernor s Preface Tavernor quotes the 1987 plaque to that effect If no one can say what from Tavernor s Preface seems to a conform to WP NOR and b support the current language of the 5 articles then yes this would be an excellent time to revert to something only a minor copy edit different than the language which,0.0070958566,0.01465689,0.003444948,0.0005953719,0.0016205944

0,1st Please don t forget to sign before leave yr comment 2nd No you saw pretty wrong the 2nd quote of the version I propose is not present in the current version 3rd Again One more time the present version has a serious flaw as I put above in the section Spurious Quotations by using a book citation in a spurious way doubly not only by stating a different thing from the original citation but mainly acting so leaving a implicit meaning totally different from the original quote To refresh your memory The original book citation states that in certain historical moment a military revolt sparked a cycle of instability while the present version using the 1st one in a partial way as reference to give a veneer of respectability states that the rise to power of the civilians a year later would have been responsible for the beginning of the overall instability Thus spurious quotation aside also a spurious correlation So if to one a eliminate such spuriousness and b put the appropriate initial causes of the instability of this period with proper references is not an improvement Well it would become not just hard but impossible to believe in this one s good faith as well as it would be the confirmation of this one s selective double standard behavior 4th Concerning to the civilians rising to power in the end of 1894 it was implied in some of my previous versions which also after more than a year were not improved neither discussed but disruptively reverted Anyway for now how about The early Brazilian republican period was nothing more than a military dictatorship Following the bubble of encilhamento and the 1st naval revolt the country entered into a prolonged cycle of general instability marked by rebellions both civilian as military that even with the ascension to power of civilians at the end of 1894 did not stop Little by little these rebellions undermined the regime in a such extent that by 1930 in the wake of the murder of his running mate it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Get lio Vargas supported by most of the military to lead a revolt Oooor The early Brazilian republican period was nothing more than a military dictatorship and pretty before the civilians rise to power in 1894 following 2 severe crisis an economic and a military the country has entered into a prolonged cycle of general instability marked by rebellions both civilian as military Little by little these rebellions undermined the regime in a such extent that by 1930 in the wake of the murder of his running mate it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Get lio Vargas supported by most of the military to lead a revolt And Last but not Least concerning to changes of Brazil s boundaries in the early 20th century it is already there in the version I propose in the foreign affairs 3rd paragraph that same one which yourself considered pretty solid So any more doubts about this paragraph,0.0060187983,0.036292568,0.00073196006,0.00057627383,0.0025322998

0,I have found the original answer in the archives garbage historic after intervention of T bel here it comes Dear Val who is also a mormon or a parrots ain t sure I found very strange that each time I am answering to one wikipedian mormons question it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you I think that the person concern Storm Rider is grown up enough to do so on its own Unless next time I am under attack you take the relay and answer that one for me as well It could be interesting If you have something to say say it so but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don t know what to say So do the wisest just shut up It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed and as you can see repeating it indefinitely like rot speach is not going to give you the ability to understand All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction more than a physical unhability to comprehend expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit As for you stupid accusation of me not being sophie what about you Are you VAL or are you rama or are you DGL626 there is a lot of nick name on wiki and all of them cover up a real name They are all a pseudonym meaning they are anonymous So if I take the name anonymous as a pseudo I will be as hiding and as showing as you are because at the end in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity So what are you trying to proove except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own I had a name this name seems now to be unavailable and I dont feel to make it again or take another Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki old rats as well as newbees hahaha and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality who is wikis first rule It is all a lie How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group It isnt equality it is power struggle It is adversity and supremacy and group pressure as here WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality HA HA Make me laught but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies Please in the future avoid using words that you do not fully understand as logic For your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously do some research first I speak 9 languages English danish french german norvegian swedish occitan latin greek and geek 5 of them fluently the others as pocket use Like german I can read a book but I dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me 2 3 weeks to get back the rythm As a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the US but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages In europe from age 11 we choose between 3 languages english german and spanish at age 13 we have to chose another one and choose between english german spanish italian russian from age 15 when we begin graduate school we have to take another one and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american and a dialect or local language and can also take hebrew 2 to 3 languages are part of the compulsory pensum I also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia and english dialect spoken in India That was for learning,0.038479015,0.0052656108,0.000957709,0.00058348395,0.00289029

0,Names With regard to Nibhurrereya the reconstructed form of this name would probably be along the lines of nib xuperw re Ancient Egyptian A Linguistic Introduction Loprieno 1995 This reconstruction reflects the neutralization of posttonic vowels and the change i e which Loprieno indicates occurred early in the new kingdom While I m at it I d like to call for the following change to be made slightly modified from my previous appeal The article gives a reconstruction of his name as tuwt ankh jama n However the Coptic descendent of twt image is indicating that would have been pronounced something like tV wa t Ancient Egyptian A Linguistic Introduction Loprieno 1995 Die Nominalbildung Des Aegyptischen Osing 1976 where V is an undetermined vowel one of e a or u in Tut s time Likewise nx living here is an active participle probably perfective so the reconstruction of this should be a n x including the effect of posttonic vowel neutralization Loprieno 1995 As for jama n Loprieno indicates that the change j before an unstressed vowel began in the early Middle Kingdom This suggests that jama n was realized as ama n by the time of Tutankhamun I therefore propose the reconstruction of his name be changed from tuwt ankh jama n to tVwa t a n x a ma n where V is a vowel of undetermined quality I have no idea where tuwt and ankh came from These just look like modified Egyptologistese to me 192 133 84 6,0.011379323,0.0029871701,0.0048186122,0.000580755,0.0023647603

0,Non Scientific I guess this article breaks just about every rule there every was about Scientific Method proving empirically that the study of biological systems is what s evolutionary and that the self appointed experts are just at the beginning of the rationality knowledge curve and not at the conclusion as they often make believe This is really sad It s sad because with the kind of dogma unsupported by facts that this article contains there is two steps backwards for every step forward Evolutionary biologists really need to clean up their act and get serious There is no credibility here compared to other hard sciences They should take a note from physicists and chemists and really do more to prove their work instead of just transfixing themselves on convenient hypothesis and staking unsupportable claims,0.0038646888,0.010126176,0.0074142003,0.0006042113,0.0017676584

0,Again thanks There shouldn t be anything too unhandleable if that s a word until it actually gets released I disagree with this decision but wheel warring won t help anything I personally think that it should be fully protected till everyone gets a chance to buy the book which would be 24 hours after the initial British release but that s just me Interesting article from Will Collier on DeepDiscount eBay and early shippin books This article was brought to my attention this morning Not sure how if it needs to be incorperated into the article but it is an interesting read q OTYxYmE5Y2UzNDMyNWQ2YzFmYTk3NzY1MTkxZGFhNzI Thanks I added the info Traces to the person who leaked the photos of Deathly Hallows It seems that the pictures leaked on the internet help the investigators because metadata saved in the pictures reveal more information Also other aspects can help to identify the person See this article This could be getting to the point where there should be a separate article entirely that traces the story of this particular Harry Potter leak considering it has led to sustained press coverage and lawsuits As this seems to be the only full leak of the entire book negating the need for disambig perhaps it should simply be entitled Leak of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Try not to get ensnared in recentism While there is still a ton of documentation there isn t an enormous amount of unique information We should wait a bit see if it can t be condensed and then consider a split Yeah I agree with that Only if it gets to the point where further legal action is taken or if this person s identity is discovered If there is enough information this would be an interesting article but it should report the story of the leak from the beginning to the ending if there will be one and background information It would also shorten the hole article Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows there should be a section where a few sentences describe what happened and then above Main Article Leak of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows But I agree with Wafulz that we should wait Dealing with inevitable spoilers We need a hideable section template That way people can post the plot details but have them hidden by default so people don t have to read them if they don t want to Talk Contrib Trust me you don t want to get involved in this type of spoiler discussion It has resulted in months of arguments on Wikipedia Spoiler several Requests for comment and a requested arbitration case I think plot details shouldn t be revealed before the book is officialy released Wikipedia shouldn t spread illegaly gotten information Considering that some people have quite legally obtained the book before its official release not all the spoilers are illegally gotten infomation Perhaps you should put a bit more thought into your comments before you make a blanket statment implying that a large amount of your fellow Wiki editors are criminals No one is advocating that T C This might be an idea you could pursue as a broader guideline if you really felt strongly about it but I don t think it should be used in this setting because all of the other Harry Potter book articles simply have a first section titled Plot overview By the way wouldn t it be assumed that a com,0.023727717,0.013013114,0.00069383386,0.00058853556,0.0019052187

0,Jdorney really needs to grow up here First off Jdorney I keep it up because you are ingnoring facts which I have continually provided proof for I have submitted to you the site sources page numbers and even posted the actual articles in which these facts are stated Either you don t bother to read them or you read them but ignore them because you are so biased in your beliefs that you only include facts that support them and in some cases you lie altogether How in god s name you are allowed to continue to be a Wikipedia editor is beyond me You basically quote two sources in the PIRA article CAIN research and Lost Lives CAIN research is a estimated source of information Jane s Intelligence the US State Dept and the Council On Foreign Relations all use official statistics for their information they do not estimate casualties as CAIN does As for Lost Lives I have the latest edition of that book and if you go through it page by page you come up with the Loyalist casualty figures and British Security Service figures i have put in the article Either you are not really reading the book or your are just lying about the figures because you know they don t support your beliefs You also misquote other books For instance The Irish War staates that 46 Loyalist Paramilitaries were killed by the IRA between 1986 1997 you state in your article that this is the TOTAL number of Loyalists killed by the IRA that isn t true The IRA killed a further 38 Loyalists between 1974 1986 but of course you leave that part out I don t know if you are some Loyalist sympathizer or what but the way in which you continually ignore the facts about how many UDA and UVF members were killed by the IRA seems odd to me I have given SEVERAL different sources for this number Books like The Irish War or the latest edition of The IRA A History by Tim Pat Coogan Jane s Intelligence the US State dept Patterns Of Global Terrorisim and the Center For Strategic and international studies Why these highly regarded sources aren t enough for you I am not sure unless you are trying to push an agenda All of the above sources agree on the number and breakdown of the British Security service people killed bu the IRA over the 30 year war As a former US Marine with experience in Counter terrorisim issues I pride myself on using the above sources which were the same sources we used in our Force Recon counter terrorisim classes And by the way the IRA was one of the main groups we studied along with groups like Hezbollah Al Qaida and the Tamil tigers These groups are known as the big four to the US Military If the above sources were good enough for the Marine Corps they are good enough for Wikipedia You need to grow up and stop deleting facts just because they don t support your own sad bias views I will file another complaint with Wikipedia about you and I will continue to edit this article to ensure that it is professional and not the work of some biased little editor who is more interested in pushing his own views then he is in the facts,0.59976745,0.029822957,0.0051174546,0.0006904823,0.0035038327

0,First I think it was SatuSuro who made the version about the Faith that is now on the page and would like to thank him for his research and work Both of the quotes I have added are verifiable I can post the references again if necessary they are not original research they are also impartial in presenting the Faith s teachings because they do not attempt to sway a person one way or another about what to believe about them but rather present them directly because they ARE the teaching Anyone elses summary of them could only be inaccurate There are no major disputes as far as I am aware about the Baha i teachings about the life of the soul after death This summary of the Wikipedia article about a neutral point of view I believe is exactly what applies here When we discuss an opinion we attribute the opinion to someone and discuss the fact that they have this opinion For instance rather than asserting that The Beatles were the greatest band ever locate a source such as Rolling Stone magazine and say Rolling Stone said that the Beatles were the greatest band ever and include a reference to the issue in which that statement was made Likewise the statement Most people from Liverpool believe that the Beatles were the greatest band ever can be made if it can be supported by references to a particular survey a claim such as The Beatles had many songs that made the UK Singles Chart can also be made because it is verifiable as fact The first statement asserts a personal opinion the second asserts the fact that an opinion exists and attributes it to reliable sources Also the Baha i Faith has been consistently among the top three fastest growing religions in the world for about the last fifty years There is sufficient public interest in it for it to be given due consideration on the basis of some other factor and size and general public knowledge about the Faith are the only two factors remaining that I am aware of As the Faith is growing faster than public knowledge can keep up with it it should not be considered solely from the point of view of the academic community so the only impartial test for how much consideration it should be given compared to other religions would be its size which is estimated at seven to ten million followers worldwide based on the most recent statistics and statements from the Baha i World Center Judaism has approximately fourteen million followers world wide,0.1775879,0.0032751067,0.0004083017,0.0005715008,0.0015989018
0,Speedy Deletion Dogsoc as patent nonsense Hi Dreadstar Could you please rehabilitate the Dogsoc article you deleted to some private talk space so that we can work with it and convert it to brilliant prose and all the other stuff Would appreciate a little room time to work on this one since it is not patent nonsense although it may appear so at first blush I will reply for Dreadstar and he can respond if he needs to Let me first explain the concept of verifiability which is a core pillar of Wikipedia Another thing is notability which basically means that you can create an acronym about something but that does not make it automatically notable Without citations to reliable third party sources such as news articles professional journal articles magazine articles etc then articles are likely to be deleted Wikipedia is not a soapbox and additionally I would like to point you to the conflict of interest guideline because your username is the same as the title of the article The COI guideline explains that editors should not create or edit articles about themselves their company organization product or family or friends as they would likely be unable to edit neutrally Neutrality is another of Wikipedia s core policies I d encourage you to review the policies and guidelines given here and once you have consider if indeed the article you submitted was verifiable by multiple reliable sources and displayed notability Cheers Ariel Gold Thanks Ariel better get some foot warmers for that poor doggie Dogsoc the article consisted of an acronym and six sentences describing what the acronym meant none of which was verifiable per WP Verifiability and which miserably failed Wikipedia Notability The only claim to verifiability was a presumed xerox copy of an underground magazine published in 1976 purportedly recently acquired and alleged to be undergoing the process of being translated and scanned The contents of the article although short were quite inflammatory making unfounded accusations against governmental regulatory assassins etc All in all it added up to quite frankly patent nonsense with no meaningful content Dreadstar Wiki has many articles devoted to acronyms such as United Nations United States of America Referring to the recently acquired document there is now a stay order of the concerned High Court on publication of this document We can Now cite the judgement s link on an OFFICIAL Govt High Court website which ought to meet reputable source verificability criteria For DOGSOC notability a simple google is this verifiable news search on Nandigram should do Finally I may mention Wikipedia s Neutral Point of View Policy which is absolutely non negotiable Dogsoc you do not seem to have read the links provided to you You say DOGSOC is on Google but here is the Google search result for DOGSOC with a total of one article from 1910 not related to this article you are claiming is notable The words you said it stands for Dismantling our Governments Selling our Cities a Google search comes up with again nothing None of this has anything to do with POV it has to do with again verifiability and reliable third party sources that establish the notability Yes USA UN and many many other acronyms have pages here but they are notable mentioned in the news media and other reliable sources This acronym is not Further you may wish to review the single purpose account guide as well Thanks Ariel Special C,0.2691886,0.056617994,0.005805344,0.0006925918,0.025674596

0,actually capacitance per say is not a problem so long is it along with the inductance and resistance of the coaxial cable results in the correct impedance 75 ohms for AES EBU It is the impedance that matters not the capacitance Failing to match the impedance which would happen if you cut the capacitance without a corresponding increase in the inductance will result in poor performance Get the impedance right and the only limiting factor will be losses in the dielectric and increasing resistance due to skin effect as the frequency goes up Even cheap TV aerial coax has a performance vastly superior to plastic optical connects,0.022707257,0.57119113,0.0053112274,0.000584789,0.0018104833

0,Re considering 1st paragraph edit I don t understand the reasons for s recent edit of this article not that I m sure that the data are necessarily wrong Rather I m persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject I note that articles about other sitting Justices have been similarly enhanced and I also believe those changes are no improvement In support of my view that this edit should be reverted I would invite anyone to re visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists A1 Benjamin Cardozo A2 Learned Hand B1 John Marshall Harlan B2 John Marshall Harlan II The question becomes Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them or either pair be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph I think not Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point Less humorous but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale At a minimum I m questioning this edit It deserves to be reconsidered,0.005310104,0.0027535392,0.0012003136,0.00056834536,0.0013789618

0,The Catholic Church example is a good one but I d like to point out several key distinctions First off its an old enough institution that a separate History of the Catholic Church article exists which makes the main article in reality The current status of the Catholic Church or maybe A summary of the Catholic Church this is not the case for the NRA We have a single article that is trying to address its entire history along with its cumulative activities so the Lead needs to reflect that Second with all of the various controversy involving the Church none of it mentioned until the last paragraph Third it s Lead 1st sentence is fairly generic simply stating that its the largest organization of its type and how many members it has I would be fine with something similar The National Rifle Association of America NRA is a nonprofit organization with 5 million members But quite frankly that seems too simplistic and not terribly descriptive or informative Furthermore if we take a clinical look at what they do today its a variety of things that range from publishing and multi media television internet etc to training and certification programs to historical preservation along with lobbying and other political activities So to describe the organization in the 1st sentence using any kind of phrase that includes gun control gun rights or the like is just bad writing and purposely ignoring significant parts of the article hence my original suggestion for the Lead first sentence At the very least I don t see why the first sentence can t just be generically descriptive Maybe something like The National Rifle Association of America NRA is a nonprofit organization that primarily serves as an advocate for firearm related issues and activities Originally founded in 1871 in New York by journal editor William Conant Church and General George Wood Wingate to promote marksmanship within the United States military the organization has gone through several transformations as well as expanded its purpose and goals In the 21st century it has become one of the largest and most influential lobbyist groups in Washington D C as well as a large multi title magazine publisher an advocate for hunters outdoorsmen and the and one of the largest firearm training and certification program operators in the U S That said I will try to find other examples but given this list Category 501 c 3 nonprofit organizations it does not seem difficult to find an article with a Lead first sentence like I ve described By the way I m advocating for a rewrite of the ENTIRE WP Lead not just the 1st sentence I think that Policy is fairly clear but IMO to adhere to it properly in this case Editor s need to quote the WP Lead page a specialized understanding of the subject in order to write it in a NPOV manner that a non specialist will understand This is something beyond what a magazine subscription or occasional mailing will provide Talk,0.0076062176,0.004118254,0.0014108226,0.000569146,0.001533666

0,As I stated one dispute with sources on the entry when there are 517 other sources in the article is not a reason to put the unjustified template on this article As I recall we have multiple sources for Ataturk and I just found another one written by a Turkish Freemason and published in Freemasonry Today here which we might already have or might not The real problem here is that according to most easily accessible Turkish sources floating around on the Internet apparently Ataturk can t be a Freemason because if he was he would also have to be a Jew and also homosexual depending on what YouTube video you watch So the issue actually has more to do with somebody cobbling together disparate pieces of questionable information and someone else disagreeing with it than it does anything else Qwl you also have a history of tendentious editing on Turkish subjects and the sheer amount of your edits that have been reverted for issues media files that have been deleted for lack of licensing and the ArbCom case which was declined because you couldn t be bothered to fill out the form tells me that you are more interested in arguing your point in any given area than building an encyclopedia based on community policies Wikipedia is not a battleground so take it elsewhere,0.010883837,0.011724815,0.002656687,0.001857257,0.0013419376

0,As a Wikipedia I am aware of the three main guidelines for editing articles about living people and feel I have not strayed from them in my editing of the article about Paul Offit On Neutral Point of View I was merely stating the conflict of interest of the studies done by the committee affiliated with the AAP claiming that the Rotateq vaccine was safe when the very academy this committee is a part of takes bribes from the very corporation that manufactures the vaccine Merck Clearly these people who receive hundred thousand dollar contributions from vaccine makers are completely unreliable on topics such as vaccine safety Studies allegedly confirming the safety of a product should never be considered reliant if done by those who would profit off them Besides 89 patients have been given the vaccine and died This along with the conflict of interest done by those who claimed the vaccine was safe shows that there is no reliable evidence that rotateq is safe Verifiability I provided valid links 1 to Medalerts describing the adverse effects where Rotateq was administered and the patient died 88 of such cases can be found on the website The second to CBS news in which Sharyl Atkisson reveals hundred thousand dollar contributions taken by the AAP from pharmaceutical corporations such as Merck and Wyeth For deaths associated with Rotateq LOWAGE ROTHB5 DATE LOW DATE HIGH DATE LOW DATE HIGH DATE LOW DATE HIGH DATE LOW DATE HIGH THREAT VAX VISIT ILL STAY DATA MEDS Yes ADMINBY DATE LOW DATE HIGH FUNDBY 1 Find 10 NONE For conflict of interest within AAP Original Research This is not original research as nothing added made any definitive claims beyond what was stated in the sources The fact that infant patients who were administered the vaccine including a set of twins died after receiving it and that the evidence provided attempting to show the vaccine is safe was essentially done by an organization tied in with the vaccine manufacturer shows that there is no reliable proof that the vaccine is safe Despite my keeping within the Wikipedia guidelines I was repeatedly blocked by User MastCell my citations deleted Some were on the excuse of libelous but they were all factually verifiable and had cited sources So then I wrote in these same facts again and along with how User MastCell is acting as a minion of Paul Offit by censoring all negative information about him however true and violating Wikipedia s guidelines as a responsible administrator Angered he has blocked me indefinitely for personal attacks when I merely wrote them in response to his own abuse of power by censoring anything negative albeit factual about Paul Offit as libelous Ironically MastCell violates all of the above His verifiability for stating Rotateq is safe comes from a Merck funded Association his neutrality is limited to the point of censoring any negative information about Paul Offit that is verifiable correct and unobjective his original research comes from drawing the erroneous conclusion that Rotateq is safe on the basis of studies essentially funded and determined by the drug s own manufacturers Therefore I appeal to nullify my week long blocking I would also suggest blocking User MastCell as he has actually violated Wikipedia Terms of Use himself especially since he holds the responsibility as an administrator the basis on which he has used to block me,0.02830235,0.0059956107,0.0034587788,0.00058043597,0.001296439

0,There is a big difference between promotion and description An encyclopedia should describe a subject objectively and neutrally If it promotes an idea it becomes an advertising tool which Wikipedia shouldn t be Describing consists of recounting facts Promoting involves making subjective judgements about the facts and encouraging behavior To include facts is not promotion although doing so while leaving out other contradictory facts is biased and can be considered promotional So the correct way to deal with pseudoscience or any other article for that matter is to describe the relevant verifiable facts about the subject whether positive or negative As for Lerner being notable he could be considered notable on two separate subjects his cosmology work and his fusion work His cosmology work received more attention in the 90s but he is still active in it today and has received some media attention His fusion work is more recent and has received some media attention as listed in the references,0.14743583,0.017240062,0.011282776,0.00057551306,0.0013993891

0,First stop deleting without cause Johnuniq my suggestion is to either provide a peer reviewed journal article for the methods of falsifiability listed in the article or provide detail as to why they would be valid methods of falsifiability or deleted that portion of the article 24 27 I was referencing 4 observations of organisms being created from above and am saying that anything that references the necessity of a deity is not allowed into science Thus this cannot be a method of falsifiability We do not allow creationism into science so why would we allow it as a method of falsifiability Thanks you for being open minded enough to not just flame me HRAFN the platypus is not a transitional species because it currently exists and little is known about the Australian fossil record Do you have a peer reviewed journal article backing your claim or are you also committing WP SOAP WP SYN Dave I have never been called an original thinker as an insult before so thanks These however are not original thoughts 1 It is not original thought to check that a listed method of falsifiability falls under the definition of falsifiability The definition of falsifiability is Falsifiability or refutability is the logical possibility that an assertion can be shown false by an observation or a physical experiment A static fossil record is not an assertion that can be shown false by an observation or a physical experiment The fact that the record is not static is a fact that tends to support evolution but not a method for falsifiability 2 It is not an original thought that the idea of a deity is not allowed into science Why would observations of organisms being created be listed as a method of falsifiability for a scientific theory when they require a deity 3 The definition of falsifiability is Falsifiability or refutability is the logical possibility that an assertion can be shown false by an observation or a physical experiment If one of these true chimeras were to be found it could still be hypothesized that they were two individual species living in symbiosis and that they evolved into what you see Since an observation of this kind would not prove evolution false it is not a method for falsifiability 4 A mechanism that would prevent mutations from accumulating is not a method of falsifiability because id JjLWYKqehRsC PA157 20PA157 Drosophila Fruit fly mutations web 20V5yPPBPE6h fOkUS qLsARelWNDqpe5uhq70mI en shows that death is a mechanism to at least temporarily stop mutations from accumulating for an entire population yet evolution has not been deemed false Dave you may be right These may be original thoughts but if they are then the science backing evolution is in a pathetic state and founded by scientists not smart enough to look at the definition of falsifiability Or more likely I cannot find peer reviewed journal articles making my claim because there are no peer reviewed journal articles stating that these or valid methods of falsifiability in the first place Thus either provide a peer reviewed journal article for the methods of falsifiability listed in the article or provide detail as to why they would be valid methods of falsifiability or deleted that portion of the article,0.32270193,0.058332108,0.021590853,0.0005817206,0.0016429588

0,Fair enough mistakes happen no problem I am attempting to move this discussion to the talk page for the article in question however I will respond to the specific issues you seem to be having here You seem to be mincing terms view such fonts as Unicode reality is actually closer to the reverse of this statement and understandably confusing very different subjects characters glyphs fonts I will try my best to address explain what I assume to be the underlying issues rather than just the symptoms The change I made to the article was nothing to do with fonts that was only apparent to you specifically the character exsited and was likely downloaded sucessfully but the font in use didn t have a glyph to display it the solution is simple use a better font if you wish to see the glyph for the character All I did was use the correct character further discussion on the article talk page once I finish typing it Unicode is the standard character encoding these days all others are now considered legacy US ASCII and ISO 8859 1 can both be treated processed as UTF 8 a character encoding for Unicode Notable operating systems and major applications in their entirity now use Unicode as their character encoding of choice adding allowing backwards compatibility where needed at least in good quality products packages This includes the majority of Microsoft products U XXXX numbers are Unicode code points an easy way to referrence specific characters without ambiguity and need not concern the average person browsing the web Wikipedia pages are sent to you as UTF 8 Unicode so you re viewing them as Unicode anyway Fonts for US ASCII ISO 8859 1 are inter changable in modern operating systems The software with which you re viewing this page is very likely written using Unicode character encoding operating system web browser Part of the reason for using the actual character natively in headings on talk pages at least was so that others could easily determine if their default system browser configuration supported a more suitable range of characters in order to be able to provide feedback about said character It s not like a missing glyph is causing an application failure in which case I could understand your concerns Your claim that My point is about everybody else who can t see the font correctly is seemingly baseless Where is your evidence that anyone beyond yourself is having trouble seeing the glyph for this character What about the people for whom the use of correct characters will help those using speech synthisis software If you can provide citation evidence for this rather wild claim I d like to read it otherwise I can t help but feel you re merely expressing your own wishes preferrences desires dispite the other issues What beyond the issues you ve encountered personally are the reasons behind your disagreement with my changes It seems that perhaps these articles are a little too close to your heart based on the nature and speed of your response es to the change Article names here should be as simple as possible emphasis mine No article names should be as clear as possible or as simple to comprehend understand as possible or provide for simplest readability I suggest it may be worthwhile to read about the subject of usability which is the dicipline concerned with making things easy to use Taking your argument further should punctuation be removed too as that would make titles much simpler although less clear Removing punctuation would mitigate the need to use percent encoding in URLs making MediaWiki itself simpler although less flexible I realise my example is counter intuitive but it was to emphasise the point that clarity above all else is actually what s important not simplicity A parallel example is user interfaces the most usable are not those which are simplest but those which display the right information at the right time clarity I m familiar with how screen readers function operate Not all ride on top of the user s browser Blind people are not the only users of speech synthisis software Besides you re confusing the visual rendering of a charater a glyph with the character itself and other representatinos renderings of it such as audio speech Modern screen readers access the source code of the page the browser itself is just a vehicle to get to the desired page and or aquire the source code itself along with the character encoding So they re given,0.012858274,0.005663876,0.00023871279,0.0005757216,0.0019406084

0,I don t think the problem is with including Latin as an example but rather that after veni vidi vici it gives a literal translation as came saw conquered and then an idiomatic translation that reads I came etc The problem is that came saw conquered would not be considered a literal translation by any Latin scholar or teacher I am a Latin teacher and I would expect the pronoun expressed in an English rendering since it s clearly expressed in the Latin The literal translation implies that Latin doesn t mark person and number on verbs which is of course false Now that I look at the other examples it looks like this problem pervades the article Someone is trying to recreate the effect of such languages I call them pro drop in English The problem is that you can t create the effect in English which is one of the points of the article i e English is not a null subject language came saw conquered does not create the effect that a Latin speaker would feel upon hearing veni vidi vici in fact I came I saw I conquered is as close as one can get to create the effect of this phrase in English,0.007565217,0.011811222,0.0006660647,0.00057485985,0.0015749107

0,Articles for creation Miriam Battista Hi Arctic Kangaroo I m totally puzzled by the reasons you gave for rejecting this article Wikipedia talk Articles for creation Miriam Battista Miriam Battista is definitely worthy of notice that is significant interesting or unusual enough to deserve attention or to be recorded It s true that her moment of national fame was short but it was intense and she continued to be noticed in the press as an adult actress Also the fact that she received a news obit not paid for by the family in the New York Times should in itself attest to her notability since the obit was published so many years after her heyday For comparison please look at the article for Gladys Hulette I certainly think that Battista rises to at least the same level of notability As far as verifiable references are concerned I truly thought I had over referenced if anything There are references to Charles Donald Fox s book Famous Film Folk Photoplay Variety The New Yorker the New York Times the Internet Broadway Database and Internet Movie Database are these not considered reliable verifiable sources If the problem is that I used too many references to privately held materials I apologize for that but I thought that the information they included was interesting and enlightening I guess that raises a basic question for me would Wikipedia prefer that information from privately held materials be omitted even if it sheds light on the subject If the answer is Yes I m afraid that Wikipedia is missing out on a gold mine of material I had been considering trying to get in touch with Wikipedia editors who are working on WikiProject Biography as well as those involved in WikiProject Film before submitting this article for review but as a newbie I wasn t sure how to do that Now that the article has been rejected I would very much like to get feedback directly from anyone involved in those two projects as well as more feedback from you Perhaps you can show me how to connect with those projects Thanks in advance for any further light you can shed on your decision and for any help you can give me,0.0032480347,0.015845407,0.0033914207,0.00057227706,0.0020584262

0,Hi thanks for taking the time to respond Avi I had presumed you were Muslim because it said on your talkpage that you had contributed to the Abbey Hill Mosque article From your response I now gather you are of the Jewish faith so sorry if I have misrepresented you at any point Have I got that right you are Jewish not Muslim I also presumed you were from the UK which is where I am from because you had contributed to an article on a UK mosque Is that right When I said most people are against it I meant that most people where I am from don t know much about it and if they did find out about the negative aspects of it such as the complications serious and minor loss in sexual function etc then they would most likely take a somewhat negative view of it I would apply this to all non circumcising cultures These people may not campaign against it or join the genital integrity movement if you could describe it as such however they would in general have a negative view of it There are a few reasons as to why I think they d view it somewhat negatively once you forced them to give their view on it It is done on children without their consent Most people would view this as ethically wrong to not have any say in a major alteration to a part of your body a particularly sensitive part at that It can cause pain people generally don t like to see children in pain They then might ask if there was a reason for it to be done They would look at the views of the medical associations via their policy statements on RIC and find out that it isn t a net positive operation therefore it doesn t need to be done for health reasons Furthermore those that are not circumcised would realise it is a needless operation because they had done fine being intact What I am saying is that most people do view it negatively if they know about it and are forced to choose they just don t bother saying anything because they do not wish to cause upset to a religious community or be accused of being intolerant I am not sure what bizarre forced circumcision you are referring to Regarding the term title of the article I don t see how calling the article Male circumcision would equate it with female circumcision I realise they are different operations but they still involve cutting of the genitals You also cannot deny that a lot of people refer to FGM as you would call it as female circumcision Furthermore a lot of people when asked to define circumcision would ask the question which type Male or female In the last post on this subject at talk circumcision I said this and I don t think you or Jake responded I took that as meaning you didn t have a counter argument to what I said My point there was that we should be as specific as possible and that being accurate is more important than using the most widely used term This is following the Wikipedia naming guidelines,0.08556269,0.011857338,0.0006530589,0.006998959,0.0019197271

0,You told me that I shouldn t write edits about general discussion on the talk pages of articles in Wikipedia But this time it was different Whereas last time you were talking about the talk pages of articles this time we are talking about the talk pages of users Whereas article talk pages were general and public user talk pages were personal and private They were different and very different from each other I thought they were personal and private I thought they were different and very different from each other When you said that talk pages were not for general discussion I thought you were just talking about the talk pages of articles not the talk pages of users Although general discussion wasn t allowed in the talk pages of articles which were public I thought they would be okay in the talk pages of users which were personal and private I thought you would not mind me having general discussion in a personal and private part of Wikipedia or at least not too much or as much as in a public part That was one reason why I didn t thought what you told me in the article talk page meant that I shouldn t make the edits then in the talk pages of those users What I did in those edits was sending telling and giving messages and requests not general discussion I thought it wasn t general discussion That was different perhaps very different from general discussion or discussion of any sort I thought it was different Whereas discussion is two way and consists of several people talking together sending messages is or can be just one way involving and being done by just one person or both Whereas discussion needs or involves response or repliance sending messages doesn t need or involve sending responses or replies The user of the talk page doesn t need to write anything in response I just wanted him to read it and do what it asked him to The messages and requests sent were not general either They were special and specific sent for a special reason about a special subject in a special time and situation Those were not general discussion also because they were done in the talk page of a user not the talk page of an article or the Reference Desk I thought that was a reason why they weren t discussion If it was done in the talk page of an article or the Reference Desk it would probably be discussion because it was one person talking and dicussing about this to lots of other people and a group in Wikipedia and telling and encouraging them to tell and discuss about it with each other in a public place But it was done in the talk page of a user it would be just sending and telling a message because it was just with one other person and telling and saying something personally and individually to him one way in a private place I thought you would not mind me having general discussion in a personal and private part of Wikipedia or at least not too much or as much as in a public part Although you may think what I did in the user talk pages was very bad it s not really that bad I thought it was not really that bad wrong and serious especially if it was just done once or only very rarely That was one reason why I did and would have done those edits on the user talk pages I didn t really know and understand how bad you would think it would be I didn t think it would be really that bad I thought it would just either result in no response from you another warning from you or a block that is at least not indefinite There were actually several reasons why it s not really that bad or at least I thought it wasn t that bad First it would not have actually made any real difference or bad effect to Wikipedia or its general and public contents facts statements and information etc It wasn t damage or disruption because it was adding information not changing or removing information It was added in a user talk page a place for adding messages and not for containing facts about one specific topic Second it was done in the personal and private part of Wikipedia It would be just the users of the talk pages themselves who would see read and look at those edits or would just need to do so and so you don t really even need to care or mind about it at least not too much Third they probably would not mind or dislike those edits onto their talk pages or they might even be glad to see them Fourth even if they didn t like having those edits being on their talk pages they could simply delete and remove it or perhaps also make a copy of it and place it somewhere else or simply just ignore it Fifth if you don t like them you could simply go to my Special Contributions and quickly delete all of those edits Those were several reasons why I thought they were not really that bad wrong and serious You don t understand me Nobody understands me I hope and wish somebody would and could unders,0.006648358,0.0062521673,0.0033082946,0.0006471783,0.0015852043

0,25 5 June 2015 UTC Myth of Flat Earth belief The titling of this article has been difficult as the myth it is about is not about the false idea that the Earth is flat see Flat Earth but of whether there was a general belief in that false idea in Europe during the Medieval Period I invite comment on whether Myth of Flat Earth belief would be a better title talk Russell calls it the modern Flat Earth Error or just the Flat Error in Inventing the Flat Earth 1991 In a 1997 conference he then refers to it as the myth of the flat earth no capitals anywhere None of these variants convey what the actual error is and of course the reason Russell doesn t try is that a literally accurate name would be quite long something along the lines of the modern misconception of a medieval European belief in a flat earth Myth of a Flat Earth belief isn t horrible but it s still not likely to mean anything to someone who doesn t already know what it s supposed to mean in which case we haven t achieved anything by changing Russell s book title works better than any of these other attempts Something along the lines of Flat Earth concoction would give less chance for someone to mistake the article as a description of the belief that the earth is flat something that has already happened twice in just the call for a capitalization change Comment We don t care if Russell likes to overcapitalize in ways that MOS CAPS doesn t sanction and the source cited above suggests that there s a myth of Russell s capitalization at work here Heh WP has a convention of not capitalizing such labels even for universally accepted theories Modern flat earth error is a good start toward settling on a WP article title that makes sense This article is about a modern belief about pre modern belief in a flat earth How do we address that most clearly Two previously mentioned possibilities were Modern misconception of prevailing Middle Ages belief in a flat Earth which has a possessive usage error and Modern misconception of prevailing belief in a flat Earth in history I think I d go with with precisely that capitalization see above RM which can and should proceed in the interim to comply with WP MOSCAPS since this what should this be titled discussion could drag out for who knows how long if it ever gets resolved 09,0.004995847,0.022259321,0.0015774589,0.00057325367,0.0021196736

0,Islamic Science There s been some discussion previously of the need for an article on the History of Islamic Science At present there is a small section of that sort in the article on Islamic Science There s a real potential for tension there because two different groups are interested in the topic of Islamic Science and these two groups define it in very different ways I am concerned that the different assumptions of these two groups may lead to unnecessary conflict which can be avoided by dividing the present article in two The article Islamic science seems to have been founded by advocates of a modern intellectual movement called Islamic science which seeks to establish the practice of science within a particular set of traditional Islamic religious norms Thus the article defines Islamic science as science in the context of traditional religious ideas of Islam including its ethics and philosophy A Muslim engaged in this field is called a Muslim scientist This is not the same as science as conducted by Muslims in the secular context my emphasis Historians of science on the other hand find this definition excessively constraining since we investigate the ways in which scholars within the Islamic world developed scientific ideas through original research and by drawing on and transforming the ideas of their neighbors and predecessors It really doesn t matter to historians of science whether the particular scientist was Muslim e g al Khwarizmi Sabian e g Thabit ibn Qurra Christian e g Hunain ibn Ishaq or Jewish e g Hasdai ibn Shaprut whether he advocated strict adherence to Muslim traditions e g al Ghazzali or was critical of tradition and open to the ideas of foreign philosophers e g Averro s or whether he worked in a religious or secular context If he studied natural phenomena and worked within the Islamic world his work fits the historians broader definition of Islamic science These contradictory expectations are likely to lead to conflict in two or more different ways When historians wish to discuss scholars who don t follow traditional Islamic religious norms while advocates of the modern movement would wish to delete these from the discussion When advocates of the modern Islamic science movement wish to discuss those modern scholars who contribute to the development of that movement while historians would wish to delete them as not relevant to the historical development of science in Islamic cultures Rather than go this unhappy route I propose an amicable divorce removing the section on the History of Islamic Science perhaps renamed History of Science in Islam and making it a separate article under the History of Science portal and leaving the remaining article on Islamic Science as part of the series of articles on Islam,0.3435114,0.00848859,0.005129016,0.0005706237,0.0013908427

0,Hey there buddy I am back a quote from Kenneth Tennyson Phd the sad thing is that our fellow here freedom skies appears to have been raised in america or britain and yet he seems more indian than american or british and along with that supports a radical view of the world that is peppered religious ideas and along with that he is educated It is truly sad if india industrializes and this hindutva movement holds sway the world will see a flourishing of a very powerful and scary radicalized country Firstly can you tell me what being American or British is America and Britain are both made of of various immigrant and former immigrant communities from Italy Ireland China Guatemala and so forth So if Freedom Skies is being proud of his culture is that evil Secondly you have an over negative estimation of countries outside of your clouded world Suggestion join the Marine Corps That is one thing I have learned is understanding the world through travel Thirdly I am utterly shocked at your comment on Freedom skies being educated as being a sad thing if not a scary thing Does that threaten you that Indians are educated Please answer yes or no no need to give a disertation or oration thank you Also that statement reminds me of when the slaveowners back in the Southern part of America during the civil war used to consider Blacks getting education as a threat to their lifestyle As a matter of fact it was illegal for an Afro American to go to school or even learn to read since it was viewed as a threat to the racist slave owners I will even go a further step to say that back then these racists from the colonial South felt threatened that the slaves would become a very powerful and scary radicalized community Regarding your previous posts here is some food for thought In the Marine Corps as a Gunny Sgt or someone in command if you are at a bar or a party you never show that you are drunk If you are drunk you do not admit it You re basically shooting yourself in the foot by admitting that you have had a few drinks while fiddling around on wikipedia and in some cases 3 cases learn from that pal,0.51024425,0.0124919405,0.007108376,0.006957556,0.0026391514

0,Again I began by saying that I don t think the word is perfect and that it needed to be worked out here rather than simply excised with an NPOV comment on the edit And actually I do have a similar remark from Raul Hilberg s mouth later in the article but I don t believe that this entirely addresses POV NPOV My point is not to say that the Anschluss cannot be viewed as the military annexation of Austria but that to view it as simply that would be to misunderstand its essence which would not in any case provide anything like absolution but does have the effect of changing the subject hence my wording tends to conceal In any case to make such a claim without remarking on its limited analytic value and obvious propaganda value would be to set aside a number of basic facts presented elsewhere in the article and to simply reiterate an argument without quotation or attribution and in any case without pointing out what immediately contradicts it is POV of a subtle sort Certainly you can always resort to attributing remarks to some and others but this is below the Gallup level of presenting opinions and does little to inform the reader or grasp essential truths For these reasons I don t think think your weasel proposal achieves neutral although it is so blandly and equivocally stated that one drops one s guard and is therefore less likely to call it out 07 52 21 Jun 2005 UTC,0.5266087,0.08861898,0.0014650878,0.0005780518,0.00519916

0,In response to Claude s last two posts Backwards of course Regarding NRMs if you ll check the list you ll see that Assemblies of God Calvary Chapel Foursquare and CMA are all considered both NRMs and denominations Just a note Also true of the Vineyard Movement of which there are many comparisons to GCA You re right that GCC doesn t like the denominational nametag but just like Vineyard many outsiders consider it to be and there is little actual semantic difference As far as what a movement is a couple definitions I found were a diffusely organized or heterogeneous group of people or organizations tending toward or favoring a generalized common goal the antislavery movement the realistic movement in art and An organized effort by supporters of a common goal a leader of the labor movement I say all that to say this Movement is a very ambiguous term more appropriate to an idea You re right that GC does use the term frequently However I think the best factual definition and most suitable for our purposes and for accuracy within the title and intro is GCAC is an association of churches That s what the AC in GCAC stands for Really that s what we actually see in existence churches Somehow we need to differentiate I think we need to start with definiing the article as about an association of churches because we have to pick a topic that is one thing plaguing us at present as editors So let s start with something real then trace the history of that association and the present I will re edit the Today section It is not NPOV at present What I objected to was not the quote but rather your original sentence before it I was confused about the date couldn t find it in your reference I was in a hurry We need to focus on what we re doing here we re putting facts up We don t need to interpret or extrapolate That quote from Bovenmeyer seems to be about church leadership with one sentence relating that to autonomy For that reason while I think it should stay it would be wrong to put that forth as the best description of the GC view of autonomy and congregational polity since neither of those is the topic Again your statement isn t found in the quote The quote itself is fine and appropriate i don t see any reason that it needs a qualifier as the quote i put above from the cong polity article says leadership authority is a common integral part of cong polity and as we all have said there is no typical view if we re going to have cong polity as a term in the GCA article people need to go there and read it also someone needs to put some serious work in on that article I don t have any problem with deferring to leaders i just want accuracy here Also note that there is a difference between an article in an official publication by one man and an official stance of the org which is listed in several places especially given the independence and autonomy of the churches within GCA,0.10102078,0.0043770554,0.0012390994,0.0005937925,0.0016899019

0,Okay there are way too many tangents in this discussion and that s my fault My point is that the scientists considered for representing the entire scientific population groups 1 3 from above are not a representative sample Therefore it is not appropriate to make the small minority of scientists claim The only accurate way to assess the opinions of a large group of scientists is to poll them as every researcher does not necessarily believe every word in a study they participate in Maybe the larger question is this what do scientist s opinions matter They don t get paid to have opinions but to do objective research Let s talk about the results Of course I think it s acceptable to have opinion based articles that are separate from the main GW article such as Scientific opinion on climate change and List of scientists opposing global warming consensus,0.7398908,0.012106373,0.0014608942,0.00058032235,0.0015128938

0,No they certainly do not have a copyright on the flags They cannot stop anyone producing a very very close imitation of their drawings But following the blazon emblazon argumentation they may have a copyright on their particular rendering of a flag even if the flag blazon is PD I think the issue is similar to maps the geodata is PD as bare facts well for the time being at least but a particular map drawn from that geodata is copyrighted We may draw our own maps but we cannot copy someone else s copyrighted map Besides I take the liberty to not support either side here As I wrote above I did not tackle the issue until now and I don t feel I know enough about the issue to give an opinion with confidence I just think that it is well possible that they do have a copyright on their images Except maybe in the case of very simple designs three differently colored stripes for instance where indeed a no originality claim might be valid But for more complex flags that argument breaks down AFAIK identical blazons have been rendered quite differently throughout history e g with animals shown in a more classical or a more modern style Take for instance Image Kent Flag gif The blazon is Gules a Horse forcene Argent Now look at the COA shown there at our flag and at the renderings on the website of the Kent County Council I think they all comply with that blazon but are all different and IMO show enough creativity and originality to be individual copyrightable works,0.25956762,0.38394395,0.0038928736,0.0006173937,0.001415516

0,Gerry Ouellette Hi there I took a look at the article and it appears that the references you added are there now I cleaned up some of the text and added a number of wikilinks and fixed the year of his first Hardy Cup win which was in 1972 not 1971 I read both of the sources you used and just so you know blogs are usually not considered reliable sources I have seen that particular blog used in other articles so I will leave it but don t be surprised if it gets removed by someone else Also the two sources appear to contradict each other One states he played for the 1972 Hardy Cup winners the other states he was only the coach while the article for Campbellton New Brunswick mentions he was both a player and the coach You mentioned on my talk page that Unfortunately the info contained in the link for Gerry Ouellette is pretty sparse and also that He is a local hero in Grand Falls N B and deserves to be recognized While this all may be true being a local hero doesn t me that the person deserves to have a Wikipedia article Having a Wikipedia article is going to based on notability and being a local hero may make someone notable to you or others in the community it s not going to make the person notable to the general population We can only write an article based on the info that s out there on the person and looking at those two sources there s not a whole lot provided I mean no disrespect when I say this but it should be pretty obvious that a subject who played just 34 games in the NHL the rest in the minors and senior hockey isn t going to be all that notable which is why there isn t a long detailed article that others have,0.02161501,0.010664387,0.0010041264,0.00061473995,0.0029033055

0,Nothing personal Radh I appreciate the input My rant is directed at Toa mostly I realize Tao you are being a smart ass as if my suggestion is not practical You like to use so called wikipedia rules to hide your empty meaningless claims How about this for a rule 1 before you comment on other people read what they say 2 before you comment on the page read the page You seem to refuse to do either and continue to make smart ass comments for what seems to be the sole purpose of antagonizing well intentioned posters You have refused to do the one thing necessary to anyone who genuinely intends to help imporove this page actually read the page and actually read others comments While I believe Radh is well intentioned he or she partly suggests things that already exist on the page please see the writers section what used to be the lead section which Doom who has been working ont his page for a very long time moved lower both Doom and I have been working on this page a very long time both Doom and I have actually read the page because both Doom and I have actually written much of this page the comments Doom and I make on the discussion page are well intentioned practical and based on knowledge of the page none of which applies to your comments Tao Not only have your comments suggested a stubborn refusal to actually read the page or read the comments of others they also demonstrate a pervasive hypocricy and your comments thoroughly contradict one another I suggested mention of the abstract expressionists as a part of broader concept of the beat generation and you go ape shit Radh suggests it and it s an excellent and practical solution It makes no sense to me I can t help thinking you have tourettes or something finger tourettes that causes you to be incapable of typing anything but bullshit Now a direct response to Radh What I am suggesting is an accurate middle of the road definition They are not simply ideas Please read my comments above According to sources I found through a search method intended to eliminate prejudice beat generation means most commonly a subculture not a close circle I m not suggesting we change the page to focus less on the close circle I m suggesting we change it to more accurately represent the truth so that certain dumbasses have context with which to argue whether or not someone belongs in the group If someone says there is no such thing as a beat artists we can point at reliable sources and point to places on the page that clear this up in a neutral accurate way So while I appreciate your good intentions Radh this is not an excellent and practical solution because it s not an actual change which would be clear to certain other posters if they actually read the article Here I ll make it easy for you Tao Beat Generation It s just right there One click away Take ten minutes take an hour whatever Being an effective smartass means being a well informed smartass,0.28875613,0.0069150417,0.0017253614,0.0009158319,0.0026753484

0,Wikipedia Requests for Comment GoRight Thanks for your kind words about my comments I d disagree though I m not convinced that GoRight was exactly baiting WMC he was more accurately confronting some clear double standards The edits which got him blocked for harassment were echoes of what WMC had said and which had been supported by as I recall Schulz Whether it was true or not those comments were set up GoRight just noticed it and said it violating User Abd Rule 0 I d call it uncivil but on a scale not worse than what had preceded it and certainly because of it s mirror nature more just I ve tried to reach out to Connolley but he rejected it which is sad I suspect that he s a good man who has fallen into some bad company Maybe they are all good men who have fallen into a bad constellation some pattern that reinforces the worst aspects of the way they are working here The incivility serves no obvious good purpose from any POV except one that would hate the project to be successful and I m sure that s not Connolley s POV In any case I have not denied the uncivil aspects of GoRight s edits I ve merely noted that they are easily explainable as a natural response to what clearly appeared to him to be an abusive cabal and what he was seeing confirmed what was in the Solomon source I believe that he is now able to see beyond that and that he s learned to not make accusations that involve assumptions of bad faith I draw a distinction between noting a reasonable suspicion that something is off and claiming that it is off I might note that a user shows characteristics of a block evading sock but I won t claim that the user is a block evading sock unless I m prepared to back it up with sufficiently solid evidence I ll only state the former as well the suspicion if the suspicion is clearly reasonable so I d just be stating the obvious which sometimes must be said And that s how I ve treated sock puppetry charges against me if there was some reasonable basis not matter how shallow I didn t charge abusive SSP filing GoRight clearly went too far but he didn t keep it up Meanwhile he was blocked in outrageous violation of block policy and I m mulling over whether or not I should do anything about that Baley has denied that there was any error in the block and this is what actually might make it necessary to go for an RfC It s pretty clear it s not marginal But of course RfC isn t the first step The first step would be something like what I just did on User talk William M Connolley The next step for me would be to attempt to identify someone Connolley might trust to give him a friendly nudge Has to be a friend not merely an ally,0.12837449,0.03657517,0.0006580022,0.0005901668,0.0020995473

0,Changes to wrong mechanical operations section to the AR 15 article 184 59 118 198 I am sure that you are just doing your job but there need to be some changes made to the AR 15 article page The following is what I suggest and if you have any questions you may want to check the Stags Arms company website at difference between Gas Piston and Direct Impingement technology for an AR 15 And I do thank you for your consideration Merry Christmas The difference between Gas Piston and Direct Impingement technology for an AR 15 Posted by Stag Arms on Fri Sep 06 2013 The AR 15 Rifle while eminently customizable carries with it a few conundrums One is the choice of operating system do you get a model which uses gas piston technology or the more traditional direct impingement Fans of the gas piston will state that impingement models are prone to jamming and often foul easily Fans of the impingement model will call gas piston tech mechanically unsound Who is correct and what is the real difference between the model types here Basic AR Functionality What makes an AR 15 an AR 15 To qualify as an AR 15 a rifle must be self loading and be able to perform a specific set of basic functions mechanically without user assistance To be more specific when depressing the trigger the rifle needs to fire a single cartridge and then extract that spent case from the chamber and eject it in some manner Next it must then load an unspent cartridge into the chamber The round is plucked from the magazine the breech is then locked and the hammer cocked The rifle will then have a fresh round loaded and again be ready to fire Direct Impingement How do the original AR 15 models work Direct Impingement is the original technology devised by Eugene Stoner Propellant gas is bled through a small hole located in the barrel which is then channeled through a very small tube where it can proceed to directly contact or impinge the bolt carrier mechanism At this point the gas is pushed to the rear of the rifle and the spent case is extracted and ejected It is then pushed forward by spring loaded action and strips an unspent round from the cartridge loading it directly into the chamber of the barrel Contrary to the statements of Gas Piston proponents we have put over 2000 rounds through rifles without cleaning and without malfunction Gas Piston Technology How do the new piston technologies work Gas piston technology was first used in modern firearms by Mikhail Kalashnikov on the AK 47 While similar at first blush to direct impingement systems there are a few key differences in operation The firing process again begins with propellant gases being bled into the barrel However instead of being forced into a tube as it is in a direct impingement system it is contained in a separate cylinder This cylinder contains a piston similar in operation to what you may find in an AK 47 The gas moves the piston is in turn pushes the bolt carrier rearward to handle the extraction and ejection process and then is moved pushed forward to the closed position by a spring just as with direct impingement ar 15 Which system is better The direct impingement has proven itself through the years on the AR 15 platform and replacement parts are inexpensive easy to obtain and generally made to a set mil spec standard Due to the hot gas from the fired cartridge being redirected into the action it will quickly heat up and become dirty requiring a cool down period before the bolt carrier can be removed from the rifle The action of a piston rifle remains cool and clean even after shooting 100 rounds in rapid succession The bolt carrier can be removed immediately and held in your hand without burning yourself The trade off for the action staying cool and clean is that you will experience snappier recoil when shooting which makes the piston rifle a little less accurate especially for follow up shots Finally piston system parts are not interchangeable between manufacturers due to there being no set standard and the use of proprietary pistons and bolt carriers 184 59 118 198,0.03688104,0.11352015,0.0011191368,0.0005981378,0.0015648917

0,Steven Colbert Why can t this guy knock it off This page was just fine until he opened his big mouth He has given the wikiadministrators a lot of greif What s his problem Because it s funny God forbid people should cause you grief by opening their big mouths You should complain about that to an authority figure It s a fact that people get paid to write biased things on wikipedia and the content can be bought If you believe wikipedia is an encyclopedia with good information and other good things then he s right reality is a commodity Wikipedia told me so and I believe what I read on wikipedia vandalism does not make things better So how many people with the attitude that reality is a commodity does it take before it s reality I have peer reviewed the idea that reality is a commodity and I agree In fact I ve decided to pick it up I love this stuff Fred pays Jim to lob a brick thorough a shopkeeper s window Who gets the blame the shopkeeper I see what you did there But there s more backstory to that shopkeeper than meets the eye So there s this shopkeeper right And this shopkeeper he has a shop that doesn t exactly sell anything He just stands in his shop all day and gives people answers to whatever they want to know Now people start noticing this shopkeeper and they feed the shopkeeper information to answer these questions as well as asking them things they need to know It becomes a tightly knitted community Things go well until people start to unquestioningly believe what the shopkeeper has to offer These people here they forget that people like them are the ones feeding him information and that whoever fed the shopkeeper this information might be just as clueless as they are But they keep asking and the shopkeeper keeps telling Then Fred here comes along and notices this from an outside perspective He notices the fundamental flaw in that the advice people are getting from the shopkeeper is just as flawed as the people who told the shopkeeper the information in the first place So Fred goes up to these people and points this out to them but nobody seems to care They re all happy as can be asking their shopkeeper whatever they need to know and blindly believing what he has to offer Some of them even retaliate against Fred for disrupting their bubble of ignorance Fred knows there s nothing that he Fred can do to stop this situation But Fred here he knows that if something isn t done people will continue to flock to the shopkeeper like cancer patients to the messiah And Fred knows guys And these guys well they just happen to own a few bricks So Fred calls up Jim slips him some money and Jim lobs a brick through the shopkeepers window Of course in this instance the shopkeeper is Wikipedia The shopkeeper s devout followers are people who use the Wiki religiously Fred is Steven Colbert Jim is anyone willing to follow Steven and bricks are the messages of those willing people who think that that anyone who uses the wiki religiously and is willing to attack somebody for calling them on it should take a step back and look at things in perspective So the shopkeeper had it coming a Steven Colbert is funy and he is only useing he s First Amendment right to Freedom of speech 2 is the Reality article ever going to be unlocked,0.34330985,0.12711419,0.088634014,0.0055139153,0.0040590484

0,Romantic Friendship Not Lesbianism This article needs to be edited to change the way it deals with the argument that the Ladies were lesbian The Laides themselves denied this and in fact I am not aware of any evidence that their relationship was sexual Yet the article refers to them as though they were in fact lesbians We must be careful not to impose modern ideas about sexual identity on people from the past In previous eras in history it was more common for heterosexuals to express their affection for friends of the same gender in more passionate terms than we are accustomed to today Indeed same gendered friends would often have an emotionally and physically intimate relationship but without any sexual content This was known as romantic friendship However since the Victorian era with its rigid attitude towards the sexual such relationships have declined and there is a homophobic tendency to brand people who seek intimate though non sexual relationships with people of the same gender as gay This is something I regard as deeply unfortunate it stems from our tendency to rigidly delineate what is gay and what is straight In some ways our modern society is very insecure in terms of sexuality,0.67970383,0.0152651435,0.01626828,0.0022284745,0.0057164235

0,Mgnbar What is a stupid act Hi consensus means that every body must agree I don t think Wikipedia have redefined the word consensus even if they try to redefine the word consensus it doesn t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid Or if my work pictures theories references text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures text and theories Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures theories and text The question is if it s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida The answer is Yes For example It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn t based on his or her own knowledge including research And according to Wikipedia rules if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn t want my report as a reference they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page If the reference is found to be wrong Then all the information pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling wear and Stress mechanics must be deleted Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research God luck with deleting all my contributions I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake,0.025893077,0.019189162,0.010827228,0.00082012045,0.002221602

0,Way I see it people who say the Sherman is a very good tank are seriously overestimating it I mean come on it was nicknamed Ronson for a reason you know Any tank that has to maneuvre around at close range to the sides and rear of an opposing tank to score a kill is definitely not good The only notable good Sherman at the end of the war is the VC Firefly but because US Ordinance doubted the 17 pounder could be fitted onto the tank it was manufactured in limited quantities The only notable features of the Sherman was that it was produced in large quantities had a mechanical reliability that beat the T 34 and came with better secondary equipment such as FM Radio and an elevation gyro stabiliser Not to mention the extremely sad stories behind it Once a Sherman maneuvered around a building to hide from a Tiger tank The Tiger shot at the building and the shell went right through and penetrated the Sherman s turret There are also tales of German tanks who take out two aligned Shermans in one shot Also do you know why you see all these wartime photos of crewmen who have Shermans with spare road wheels and tracks welded onto the hull Those are efforts to help augment the armour of the Sherman,0.015393486,0.0416719,0.0008754272,0.00063837477,0.0031568247

0,Bangladesh Law Minister s criticisms regarding Drishtipat The reason we have cited the report regarding the Bangladeshi Law Ministers comments about Drishtipat s partiality toward the Awami League is because Drishtipat themselves put the Law Ministers comments and their response together under the heading Drishtipat response to the law minister s allegation on their site If the organisation itself felt criticised and responded then it is hardly controversial to presume that it was Drishtipat that the Law Minister was talking about I m sure Drishtipat knew their own position and intentions better than the moderator Ragib on Wikipedia Besides in Bangali politikospeak the governing party of the day rarely criticises an opponent by name For example when the BNP were in power they would use oblique language like a certain party is causing violence in Bangladesh with reference to hartals Everyone would read between the lines and know that they are criticising their main opponents the Awami League It s hardly rocket science It is therefore reasonable as a citation of the governments position and the Law Minister also expanded on the reasons eg partisan reporting re government achievements,0.060937732,0.007716416,0.030647838,0.0005867713,0.0021077974

0,Block I have just been blocked by user FeloniousMonk for issues surrounding the entry on Christopher Michael Langan This entry has been fraught for some months but my contribution has been confined to the last week or so I acted several days ago on a longstanding request by the subject of the entry to remove what he considers a potentially libelous section of the entry User Jimbo Wales judged the section to be blatant original research and deleted the section This followed many months in which several editors including FeloniousMonk refused to see any problem with the section Some editors were needless to say displeased with this correct decision by Mr Wales and argued against it although they did not try to re place the deleted section I have provided extensive arguments on various other content issues to do with the entry Progress was being made toward improving the article but some users whom I consider clearly biased against the subject of the entry had difficulty accepting these arguments Other editors agreed with my arguments which were extensively but politely put Some editors changed their position on some issues such as the issue of whether to include certain links which user Arthur Rubin originally opposed the inclusion of deleting them with little reason given later acknowledging that inclusion of the links was legitimate FeloniousMonk is an editor involved with the entry and he is blocking for reasons of a content dispute This is in violation of policy In addition he has not provided any arguments why my edits are sanctionable I do not believe there was a problem with my edits the vast majority of which were confined to the talk page of the entry and I would ask any administrator to examine my record My userpage contains some links at the bottom to recent important edits in relation to this entry including many by myself Some users implied that I was in fact a sock puppet for the subject of the entry I realised just before this block was placed that a checkuser request was conducted a couple of days ago that showed I was unrelated to Langan I in fact live outside the United States do not know the subject am not a proponent of his ideas and am not a proponent of intelligent design I have stated this previously on several occasions A link to the checkuser request is located at the bottom of my user page This block is a clear violation of policy by an administrator and an abuse of power,0.75701153,0.008131136,0.004593541,0.0005790709,0.0017644822

0,Is Ethylene Glycol a Synonym for Antifreeze Update 2 My intent in editing out the extraneous information of ethylene glycol poisoning in the Antifreeze article is that many editors and visitors to the Article are of the impression that all antifreeze is ethylene gylcol This is a misconception Case in point Look above at the comments made by Flyer22 and TechnoSymbiosis 1 Note that they mention articles in which the poisonous chemical is the Article in question 2 Lead Mercury element Asbestos Benzodiazepine paracetamol That is a list of six 5 chemical substances and asbestos which is virtually a chemical species for the purposes of this discussion 3 Note also that the article in question here is not about a specific chemical rather it is about a wide range of substances including the poisonous and deadly methanol and ethylene glycol The article isn t about a chemical species like mercury or lead It is about liquids plural which have special properties in commerce and mechanics and discusses practical applications of chemicals So when auto mechanics or airplane mechanics discuss antifreeze or when chemists discuss it or talk about it this poisoning aspect is a rare but useful part of the discussion It is only when talking about this topic medically that the need arises to discuss the many symptoms and embark upon long winded treatises on what happens internally to a person intoxicated on a particular antifreeze In commercial practical and chemical discussions the fact that something is toxic arises obtusely to the main concern Take those ethylene glycol warnings to the Ethylene glycol page and if there was any sudden interest in it to the Methanol article which would be consistent with the 6 examples listed above As a sideline why aren t there any warnings of the deadliness of methanol which is soooooo poisonous that it takes 10 mL of it to blind a person and 30 mL to kill Sounds pretty notable by the above standards so let s list all of the symptoms in the antifreeze article too Or not That would be borderline absurd since the ethylene glycol lobby dictates that ethylene glycol is synonymous with Antifreeze Another absurd corollary would be to go to the Thermal insulation page and discuss how poisonous Asbestos is I mean all insulation is asbestos right To summarize this argument is about the scope of Antifreeze I don t think this scope encompasses the symptoms of poisoning from a particular type of antifreeze which happen to be so difficult to spot that they deserve the full attention available at the Good Article named Ethylene glycol poisoning where all of the nuances of medical research and diagnosis can be discussed at length So fix the misconception don t just blank an entire section Most antifreeze is still ethylene glycol It s hardly an obscure risk No one is or has stated that ethylene glycol is a synonym for antifreeze And the misconception that all antifreeze is ethylene gylcol can also be mentioned in the aforementioned section although I have not read anyone in the discussions about this on this talk page express any misconception especially since you ve expressd such concerns before Somehow you are completely missing the point about why you are wrong to repeatedly remove this information The point is that ethylene glycol poisoning which is a part of this article causes these symtoms and therefore there should be an appropriate summary of these symptoms per WP Summary style before pointing readers to the article about it It is not extraneous information So once again I will contact WP MED to comment here on this issue In the meantime this information stays per the WP Consensus against your repeated removal of it 134 255 247 88,0.026580965,0.05005029,0.012518551,0.00060875434,0.0014768048

0,If you remove this article OK but still I doubt that you catch the most general aspect of curvature in the sense of Nomizu Kulkarni and other modern writers Look at the reference where you find more references In the references there look also that one in Lecture Notes in Mathematics you find a decomposition of the space of all curvature structures in terms of Lie and Jordan algebras And you find how elegantly electrodynamics and gravitational waves fit into the curvature play look at the basic work of Lichnerowics As an algebraiker I like to write the curvature structure in the following triple form generalizing the concept of Lie triples the book of Otmar Loos is a nice generalization of Lie theory x y z R x y z This concept generalizes the notion of a Lie triple to that one of a curvature triple where only the Jacobiidentity is missing but a reference to the bilinear form is added in such a way that R x y is an element of the pseudoorthogonal Lie algebra Note that the complete work of Ricci Einstein and Weyl can be summarized as a decomposition of the space of curvature structures of Levi type for Lie algebras All this shows that we do not yet understand this curvature space completely Especially the gravitational wave aspect needs clarification Hannes Tilgner,0.15913942,0.20184761,0.0018546027,0.00057331024,0.0024413338

0,jftr what the above refers to Former MPs do have working links in Parliament If you weren t so eager to smash things rather than fix them you would have noticed that And you couldn t even be bothered to let me know there might be a problem I hope our paths never cross again but I suppose I ll have to watch your contributions in future to make sure you aren t deleting everything I do What a waste of time Oh yeah I ll assume you were smashing in good faith As if Thanks for ruining my formerly good mood as I was enjoying making some useful contributions to Wikipedia articles Welcome to Wikipedia Now a recap With this edit you added a link to the current MPs list for Carter Problem was it was for David Carter not John Carter so I removed it I went to replace it with one for John Carter but there is none so I couldn t You then added another link but like the first one it too went to the wrong person this time Cam Calder I removed it with the edit summary Cannot replace it because Carter is no longer an mp You have responded by inserting a brand new link to Former MPs I was unaware Carter has been added to that list but that is beside the point because I was removing links to current MPs If you intend to edit Wikipedia for a while I suggest you don t shout in your edit summaries as you did with Former MPs DO HAVE WORKING LINKS Wikipedians fix links rather than delete them and you address the actual issue and don t jump to conclusions Not true The actual issue was that you deleted ALL the links I added for him That is the recap The two other links worked fine but you deleted them as well in your hurry to smash everything someone else did In other words you are the one who jumped to conclusions Now you re trying to claim you only deleted the one that was a problem Even your edit summary is wrong The man s resignation was presented the same day I was adding the links unknown to me so it seems the Parliament link was being moved from current to former which caused pointer problems when I clicked on it Things happen It only needed to be fixed I would have thought an Admin would be capable of figuring that out Nor could you figure out how to leave a message on my Talk page so I could figure it out You just couldn t wait to smash everything I only came back to the article because I was going through the non Cabinet people on the list Did you fix that list once you realized this was a former MP No you did not That would have been work requiring thought and effort Same as you mis corrected the hat note on the other John Carter MP Based on your arrogance I thought it likely you were an Admin What a surprise I was right And Jimbo wonders why the numbers of actual contributors are going straight downhill I have NO intention of continuing to contribute to Wikipedia because you obviously would prefer to do everything yourself You re not at all welcoming helpful polite assuming good faith or anything else I was led to believe is part of the Wikipedia ethos So I leave you to it You didn t even have the grace to apologize for deleting the other links you just tried to blame me in this audit trail Go lecture someone else because I m out of here and you can be sure I won t be encouraging anyone else to participate in what could have been a good project Your attitude is horrendous and I m sure I m not the first one you ve chased out of here Well keep it up and you ll soon have the whole thing to yourself Enjoy Go brag to your friends that you got rid of another contributor I m sure you re very proud of yourself,0.1483416,0.02503006,0.00029562658,0.0005966352,0.0016679841

0,I m moving this article back to Nancy Cartwright actor and making Nancy Cartwright a redirect to that page I d rather Nancy Cartwright be a disambiguation page but to minimize the possibility of further disruption and to give this discussion a more appropriate home I think that s a good compromise for now That way no matter what happens with Nancy Cartwright we can be sure that Nancy Cartwright actor will always work correctly and the discussion can stay on Talk Nancy Cartwright where it belongs As for the value of two article disambiguation pages they let the reader and editors know that there is more than one person with that name in a much more noticeable way than a hatnote It makes it a lot easier to check that links are made to the correct article since ones to an unqualified name will show up in the various links to disambiguation pages reports,0.0115303565,0.5950949,0.0013529989,0.00057472015,0.0018492884

0,The problem is the wider we cast the net in terms of subject matter for the article the more room there is for disagreement and debate Energies are dispersed and the article becomes lopsided and uneven Read the article on Human skin color This article discusses the various theories about human skin color One scenario is that fair skin is the result of spontaneous random mutation that theoretically there were white skinned people the result of genetic mutations in Africa but they simply did not survive to produce progeny that the same mutations occurred when humans migrated north but because of the climate those mutants survived to bear and rear offspring Another scenario posits that humans initially were pale like simians but as they began to lose their hair their skin darkened over time as a climatic accommodation And there are other theories as well You want to get into melanin in this article and the accompanying sturm und drang of agrument disagreement and potentially more edit warring just look at what s happened here with a far narrower piece and for material that eventually will be cut out anyway The mechanics of melanin This still reads like a phenomenally bad idea,0.74684876,0.024577145,0.003845352,0.00059373357,0.0014803391

0,I don t get it So if someone would be to travel through time their actions would have no effect But time travel itself affects the past you re taking something from the present and putting it in a different point in time thus for the context of the earlier point in time you travel to introducing matter energy whatever that didn t exist there before thus as per chaos theory possibly screwing up everything Any successful travel through time would have an effect otherwise it wouldn t be time travel With that in mind does the principle boil down to time travel is only possible if it has no effect thus time travel the possibility of which necessitates having an effect is not possible The matter and energy of which the time traveller and his clothing etc consists would if the universe is a closed system have been in use by something else at an earlier point in time and thus a re allocation of matter and energy already existent at that earlier point in time to recreate the time traveller doesn t seem to be a viable alternative either But if the time traveller can neither be composed of matter and energy that didn t exist nor of that which already existed but was in use already what does he consist of Even if the universe is not a temporally closed system i e matter energy can vanish and re appear at future points in time for something to vanish in the present and re appear in the past it would have to vanish before its original appearance unless it can t exist twice at the same point in time i e if atom A was sent back in time from a point Z to a point X it would vanish at point Z now and appear at point X back then as A but have to vanish again as time advances closer to the point Y somewhere before point Z where it was originally introduced as A otherwise A and A which should be identical would exist at the same point in time which would definitely be an alteration of past events and thus incompatible with the principle I m assuming the principle isn t based on the simplification of the idea that the only thing that matters is the action inaction of humans as in the interpretation of Schroedinger s experiment that the cat is in an unknown state where it is both alive and dead until the human interacts with it which implies the human s perception determines the state of reality If that is true then the example from Twilight Zone where someone goes back in history to start the fire he travelled back in time to prevent is clearly contradictory as it introduces a paradox a time travel having to have occurred in order for the time travel to occur unless it actually changed the events i e originally the fire would have been caused by something else which would still be inconsistent with the principle which doesn t allow for any changes of the past I m aware this post is getting a bit rant y but I m seriously at a loss here How does time travel NOT change the past regardless of whether it has any consequences in the grand scheme of things or not The very concept of travel backwards through time is that one appears at an earlier point of time thus changing the past The only possibility I can think of for time travel not to change the past is a paradox in which the time travel happens because it has already occurred i e the future representation person A of someone person A appears in the present and at some future point in time the same events cause person A to travel back in time that already caused person A to go back in time i e both of their time lines are identical but in which there is no other time line in which the time traveller didn t already appear before travelling back in time i e there is no time line in which person A travels back in time without person A having travelled in time already i e where person A doesn t eventually become person A the time traveller All of this is obviously rendered null and void if the laws of physics are inconsistent and random stuff does appear out of thin air for no reason talk contribs,0.004514076,0.35645404,0.00066089793,0.00057121064,0.0016060378

0,There should be some priomordial quality mandate Wikipedia should want quality verifiable references If WP VER is intended to be weaponized then a bot could be made that deletes pages and sections based on whether the section contains an insufficiently prestigious reference Treating WP VER as an intentional algorithm would allow an attacker to delete perhaps as high as 90 of wikipedia without even needing to look at the content No one could invoke any objection to the mass deletion if the literal interpretation of WP VER is the most important rule on wikipedia Vandalism becomes impossible if criteria for removal applied to a science page can be robotically applied to a philosophy page The above attack would meet a common sense interpretation of vandalism The only possible protection from the mass deletion attack is if WP VAN is considered to have higher priority for literal interpretation than WP VER There should already be a common sense acceptance that Vandalism is more dangerous and objectively assessed than the quality of referenced material and as shown above rejecting the statement binds wikipedia to a suicide pact Its my view that the recent deletions are indistinguishable from robotic vandalism and they deleted high quality and verifiable references based only on the content hosting platform If Vandalism and Verifiability are to be equally considered in actions then restoring the content and tagging it as needing better sources should be done Also if there is to be a defense from robotic deletion of the majority of wikipedia then deletors that have shown no previous contribution to the page should be treated more suspiciously than those who have helped build it,0.50812876,0.4156127,0.058882955,0.0006639826,0.002018061

0,FK Vardar FK Vardar is a Macedonian Football club the club changed its name several times during its history from original Vardar in 1911 to Citizens Football Club Vardar or just Citizens Gragjanski in Macedonian in 1920 then Football Club Makedonija in 1946 and finally back to FC Vardar in 1947 By the name FC Citizens Vardar the club won 4 championships from 1936 till 1939 About Yugoslavia you have to know that Yugoslavia was a federation of 6 Republics countries together and each Republic had its own championship and there was a Federal League where teams from the Republics competed together Each Republic had its own Cup and the cup winners competed in the Marshals Cup that cup was held in honor of Joseph Broz the marshal of the Federation and its was called the Cup of the Marshal How ever FC Vardar never won the Federal league League made of Federation of 6 Republics best teams thats why its called the Federal League and not Yugoslavian League nor Yugoslavian Cup The title in 1987 was won by FC Partizan Belgrade you can check in any official statistics or documents The second federal league was made of two Second Federal Leagues East 3 Republics competed Serbia Monte Negro Macedonia and two Provinces almost the same as Republics but yet without a nation those were Kosovo and Vojvodinship and West 3 Republics Croatia Bosnia and Slovenia sometimes clubs from province Vojvodinship would compete in the West depending on the federation decisions In the period of 1922 till 1929 present day Republic of Macedonia was established as 4 provinces within the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes those 4 provinces were Skopje Bitola Shtip and Vranje prvinces These 4 provinces established the Macedonian Football Federation in 1926 and they held 3 championships In 1929 these 4 provinces joined in one Duchy and this championship was held in the Duchy Banovina for 11 times During the WW2 the championship was held under German Occupation and the German government recognized this League After the WW2 the very same championship was tranformed in to Republic Football League just the Province of Vranje was separated from the Republic as Macedonia transformed from Duchy to a Republic and the province of Vranje was under the newly made Republic of Serbia in 1946 The bottom line is since the Federation of 6 Republics split in the 90s Macedonian Republic League was transformed in to Macedonian First League So it is the same League that changed names and competition format during the decades and now it came to this Level Its a petty that there is lots of politics and territorial pretensions lots of denial of the existence of the Macedonia and other Republics in the Federation by the Serbian side Serbian official politic is to show that Yugoslavia was one country and nation mainly based on Serb character and they are stilling all the history including history of sports in this case football They are trying to show the world that there was Yugoslav nation Serb and only Yugoslav Football league Serb League denying the Federal League second Federal League and Republic Leagues They want to show only Yugoslav League and not the real Federal League They hold all the champions from the Federal League as Serbian Champions in every competition For FC Vardar at this point of view considering that Macedonia is not in the Federetion for more than 20 years and it wont be in the future the most important are the titles and trophies won in the Macedonian League and if you wont to put additional trophies won in the Federation the period before 1991 you should write the precise information Second Federal League East is the name of the competition and you should put the Macedonian Flag from that period of the time next to it instead of the federal flag simply because that federation dont exist anymore and doesnt represent any country nor nation About the cup you should write down the real proper name as it was called Marshals Cup also fallowed by Macedonian flag from that period of the time you should put a notice that in the Federal Second League East clubs from Serbia Macedonia and Monte Negro competed including the provinces of Kosovo i Vojvodinship,0.0027814293,0.27680916,0.0091255,0.0005812276,0.0016039846

0,From local anesthesia Text removed from local anesthesia which IMO might be better placed here please review Generally a certain risk of local tissue damage is involved when using local anesthetics often and regularly during a longer period at a specific location of your body For example the chronic use of topical eye anesthetics in chronic eye pain would almost certainly and relatively quickly lead to serious eye damage corneal damage Before using local anesthetics chronic local pain should not only carefully be assessed with medical specialists for the local problem for example an ophtalmologist dermatologist dentist or a neurologist specialist for peripheral nerve blocks but also by specialists for centrally active pain medication Medical specialists ophtalmologists dermatologists dentists or neurologists for peripheral nerve blocks for the local problem can assess how big the risk of chronically using local anesthetics at that particular location is In most cases of chronic pain it is not the peripheral nervous system but the central nervous system that is not able to cope with the pain impulses coming from the location in the peripheral nervous system where the damage that causes the pain is actually located Therefore medical specialists for the central nervous system usually a neurologist or pain specialist can assess if and what kind of centrally acting medication can or should be taken Very often it is less harmful and risky to use centrally active substances especially when they are only taken in low doses against chronic pain in the peripheral nerve system than chronically using local anesthetics at a particular location of the body Relatively risk free especially when taken in small doses and at the same time often effective against chronic peripheral pain are antidepressants of the SSRI class and the stronger tricyclic antidepressants like for example amitriptyline Furthermore modern anticonvulsants like pregabalin or gabapentin are relatively risk free and at the same time relatively effective against chronic pain at least when taken in very low or low doses One of the strongest and more risky options in the reduction of peripheral pain are anticonvulsants like carbamazepine On the other hand some other classes of centrally acting substances like for example opioids they are unfortunately still often used in the treatment of chronic pain including local pain in the peripheral nerve system are extremely harmful and should be avoided in the treatment of chronic pain at all costs,0.02185999,0.008774837,0.008027335,0.0005741067,0.001430583

0,One of the issues that keeps getting brought up is the lack of evidence on the First Vision It s been said repeatedly that there s no historical evidence that Smith had this vision and that it wasn t historically significant enough to be discussed in the context of his early life Let me counter this with a short quote from the Preface to Robert Remini s biography on Joseph Smith I should make it clear at the outset that I am not a Mormon As such I faced several problems in writing this book one of which involved Joseph s visions and revelations which are crucial to an understanding of him his Church and the times in which he lived After considerable thought I decided to present his religious experiences just as he described them in his writings and let readers decide for themselves to what extent they would give credence to them I am not out to prove or disprove any of his claims As a historian I have tried to be as objective as possible in narrating his life and work Remini p x In his book Remini presents the First Vision as Smith said it happened the same as other biographers do and the same way I believe we should do Like Remini we should not be trying to prove or disprove any of Smith s claims but unlike Remini or job is fairly simple We don t have to worry about what was historical and what was not We don t need to do original research Our job is to reflect reliable sources,0.0051239915,0.005426189,0.0015041657,0.0005683313,0.0014858143

0,Reply No admissions made nor is this anything ridiculous never mind your opinion Like I said you just want your opinionated version everywhere please spare at least the talk page And if you are talking about being lame you for yourself added a citation tag to my comment here this is a talk page ffs how lamer can you get The Girvaaurus were the first people to discover Maldives and they sailed from the Malabar Coast which constituted erstwhile Tamilakam back in the old times And the Maldives like many of the island territories in the Indian Ocean was under Chola rule for a brief period and hence is mentioned in one of their Chronicles Its a pity your knowledge relevent to Maldiveds is so limited and yet you can actively spend time in searching out an e book and check out how many Tamil and Malayalam words exist in them Whatever goodwill and constructiveness are you talking about I cannot comprehend Clarifications II I am totally unable to comprehend all that you have flooded into here but I ll try to answer them all in a brief possible manner unlike you who only seem interested in diverting and escalating everything Chiefly the content here talks of Maldives being a translation of Mala Dvipa in Sanskrit and Mahiladiva in Sinhala It only says MAY HAVE DERIVED and not that it had been derived likeyour POV claims So since I am not convinced of this fact nor can you convince me why don t you simply blank the section and I might as well keep mum and go away as well Mala Dvipa in Sanskrit translates into Garland of Flowers which in turn in Tamil becomes MalaiThivu So the list is not only giving a translation of plainly the term Maldives into Tamil but rather supports the claim that which means Garland of flowers the google translates is as not maldives if it was only a name translation was used to refer to the island I had already accepted and told this too that the first source bore no significance But I never used it to clarify the content that was there it is OBVIOUS I am using the third source and you are just making it seem you were ignorant or too stupid to scroll down and verify You were well aware and there is no use pretending talk contr mail,0.030616654,0.0770639,0.0014774025,0.0035073878,0.021638412

0,PLEASE READ BEFORE ADDING ANY MORE RUBBISH As far as I can see Wikipedia has become a very turgid shadow of what I originally signed up to and I really can t see any point editing it any more Having followed the climate articles for many years and now having a great deal of expertise I can no longer just sit back and hope that Wikipedia will some day come around to a NPOV There are certain simple things that are so obviously POV pushing that it beggars belief that they still go on Not using common names when they are used by everyone else Not admitting simple facts like it is not currently warming Pretending global warming is a scientific issue when everyone knows it is mainly political rhetoric even when practised by the scientists And don t you dare think I m pushing POV I have not once added anything to a climate article without first seeking consensus which basically means I have never edited a climate article I KNOW WHAT IS A NPOV BECAUSE I HAVEN T FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED FROM WHEN I USED TO BE A GLOBAL WARMING ADVOCATE AND NEITHER HAVE MY VIEWS ON THE ENVIRONMENT CHANGED I JUST CAN T STAND PEOPLE BEING DISHONEST AND I JUST THINK SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS From the day I first tried to get a NPOV on the climate articles when I used to work in wind and was openly saying global warming is happening till today I haven t once managed to get a substantial change toward NPOV into a climate article I m angry not because I f cking wanted to put the sceptical view it is because you bunch of pr s have turned me into a sceptic because you refuse to see the obvious POV pushing that has been going on And the great consolation is that the climate articles have been so POV that most decent people can spot it a mile off and what with climategate the propaganda in Wikipedia is no longer considered a reliable source,0.6521554,0.39603046,0.005764995,0.002745796,0.0052266223

0,Imagine finding an article in which every single word is wrong and you will imagine my pain at reading the current Martin Heidegger article Nor am I the only one who thinks this Please see the section immediately above this article Or better yet spend the next 24 hours reading the first sections of Sein und Zeit and you will see the ridiculousness of the article as it currently stands which demonstrates no understanding of Heidegger and leaves everyone who reads it dumber than when they began and knowing less about everything This is so atrocious that essentially the entire article as it stands needs to be deleted and began again I have no more time for this I tried to move the Dreyfus to the main article and now apparently all the material is destroyed Do you have any comprehension of how bad this article currently is One would have no idea that Heidegger was ever read anywhere outside of France from the current article No summaries of Heidegger s important concepts are given No understanding of any of Heidegger s ideas are conveyed Since you have decided to destroy my work you can keep your poor article which reads as if it was machine translated from a foreign language You do not even let someone in the middle of working finish before you destroy their work No wonder zero academics contribute to this site and your articles are so atrocious Anyone who reads the article as it currently stands comes away knowing less about Heidegger than they did before because of all of the obvious distortions and gross inaccuracies You have not even succesfully explained a single one of Heidegger s terms or concepts here or why anyone should care who he is This article is an embarassment indeed Words are important rather than space on the screen because people have different size screens I have a 27 inch screen and a 5 inch screen both of which I edit on The lead is the same amount of words on both screens but not the same number of screens for two different users Word counts give a reasonable approximation of length not dependent on the particularities of users devices fonts and other non content formatting Generally essays list word limits not page limits so page limits aren t just fudged with font changes and others Preceding unsigned comment added by talk contribs,0.5055963,0.014340117,0.012985945,0.00064774544,0.0033269436

0,I think that it is important to mention national syndicalism at the beginning as that eliminates a good amount of the problems with temporality associated with some of the more generalizing and overarching terms that have been suggested As for the left right thing it should be apparent that national syndicalism itself was a nationalistic movement but the economics they embraced were not generally what would be considered right wing I agree that it is problematic to harmonize all of the elements but the next paragraph focuses on the right wing stuff i e totalitariansm etc and the third paragraph delves into the economics ideology Neither of those is contradictory to the lead Fascism arose during a fragmentary transitional period and it ideology embraced what today may seem to be contradictory elements It s probably better to try and get that across earlywhich the reference to national syndicalism should facilitate than oversimplify Regarding the deleted material I think there are some claims made there that would have to be sourced and attributed or based on a substantial body of text in the main article that provided context and sourcing It should be borne in mind that the WWII era fascist states of Italy and Germany along with the then quasi fascist Japan formed the axis for example so the claim of xenophobia seems somewhat specious to me though ethnocentrism sounds plausible Just because it sounds plausible however does not mean that there are RS describing it as such Militarism is a common thread but how does monumental architecture relate to that The sentence seems somewhat forced so there has to be a concrete source connecting those in an intelligible manner,0.55226034,0.054472752,0.006838597,0.00057304004,0.0013313721

0,Issue on images still unresolved Slim I m copying this message and my reply to your page for your notice I appreciate your inputs in Image talk Monkey3 jpg and I agree once in a while I might sound rude purely unintentional since I put facts blantly But SlimVirgin is abusing his admin power to overrule anyone Slim is not a he Given that she named herself after a Javanese princess perhaps you could take the hint and note that she s a woman Also I don t think you were simply blunt I think you were rude to Slim I recognise it s a fine line but given that I ve mentioned it to you perhaps you ll take more care to stay on the right side of it She has suggested in an email to me that she is in talks with another editor Now I don t know who this other editor and i certainly don t like this secrecy Instead of having a discussion on this she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors She could ve atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him her Perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input I think that would be reasonable I have a high regard for Slim and I don t think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party Inso far as the images are concerned I had stated to her a couple of images on one issue animal rights is ok but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by PETA and its assocites So you have a dispute You need to recognise that you are not necessarily right You disagree about how many images are necessary I feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy This should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization The BUAV is not a controversial organisation It is a highly respected body whose voice is listened to in all circles of British society A viewpoint doesn t become controversial just because you don t share it Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints But you expect it to reflect your viewpoint thus I requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to 2 3 images which can be used across similar articles this she refuses I don t see how it is any fairer to use one two or ten images in this instance While I agree that Slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images I simply don t feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight One factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use that s true but it s only one factor and obviously each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole As far as the other images some are on personalities she claims have agreed to use their photos here Unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can I believe First of all you can believe Slim because you assume good faith Perhaps you re not aware of that policy Yes you can ask Slim to provide evidence of that but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement Harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won t believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith Once I pointed out that permission photos would be deleted anyway she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her Yes okay Trust her AND ask for proof Both of us are editing in good faith but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other me relies on the hope that ppl like you will help me out in this I d urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities Yes Slim does have powerful friends who will back her regardless but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her If she gets away with this and sets a precedence then I m afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb Wikipedia with copyrighted information I think that s a bit dramatic but I agree that she has to obey the rules which exist for good reason and shouldn t be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom However she is not a copyviolater trying to destroy Wikipedia Partly I think she simply didn t understand your problem and that was in part a failure of your communication and partly she has become too used to having her views echoed by her friends and doesn t handle disagreem,0.08734052,0.03166338,0.00071569136,0.0005907966,0.0022208665

0,The lead is quite unbalanced as it is supposed to be a brief summary and introduction to the main text and yet 1 3 is about historical cultural religious aspects of circumcision which only occupies a small portion of the article itself I agree that information in the lead should be in the article under the relevant section perhaps as the opening paragraph but given there are already articles for religious practices it is unnecessary in the lead It could be reduced to one or two short sentences that state that there have been and still are historical cultural and religious practices that involve circumcision but without going into detail This is a medical article and the use of circumcision as an initiation ritual is a different subject to medical circumcision Only where medical circumcision has itself become part of cultural practice should there be a focus on that manifestation of circumcision as cultural practice,0.13893603,0.02066335,0.004978054,0.0005690871,0.0016414571

0,Re I m not sure what you mean by different ground They differ in their POV While Notable assassinations of the Sri Lankan Civil War is written according to WP NPOV Assassinations and murders attributed to the LTTE is functionally a WP POV fork I say functionally because it historically preceded the other article so it hasn t been created with that intention However I feel that the decision to keep a POV version in addition to an NPOV version amounts functionally to the same as creating a POV fork That is certainly not a reason to keep the latter Re I assume you re talking about WP SIZE There is absolutely no reason to be worried about that WP SIZE is not a policy but a guideline so it the statement itis agaisnt wikipedia policy is simply wrong The guideline says Readers may tire of reading a page much longer than about 6 000 to 10 000 words The article body currently has 935 words so we re not even close by any stretch of the imagination Even if we were close the guideline specifically says No need for haste Even if we were beyond the recommandation there are many other ways to split articles Splitting it by POV is not the way to do it In conclusion I am not convinced by any of the arguments I don t see any benefit for Wikipedia if we kept the LTTE article Since this is not an official mediation and since the three opposing editors have not applied for WP SLR membership I have no mandate or obligation to represent them Nevertheless I want to regard their needs The fact that we see some unconvincing arguments could indicate that there are other unexpressed needs which the LTTE article satisfies If that is the case then there could be more at stake than just a harmless redirect If that is the case then I recommend bringing it up on WP AFD,0.26553398,0.07827231,0.0026324904,0.00058267446,0.0014217158

0,In Response to gren s Comments on Zeno s Edits of the POW Section recently commented on my edits in another section I will address them here if you are going to make large changes on controversial articles it is as you say necessary to discuss them and come to a concensus No such thing happened with Zeno s edits and for lack of time I reverted to the less horrible version it s not true that I have not discussed my edits Nor have I made a large change to the article I have concentrating on one sub section of the article and I have concentrated on a small number of facts regarding the treatment of POWs i e the facts that they may be executed enslaved for labor or sex ransomed or freed These four options in Islamic law concerning POWs are well known amongst academics and scholars as my sources have proven So my edits have not been making any large structural changes to the article I have concentrated on one sub section and have elaborated on these four facts And as I said I did discuss these edits contrary to your allegation I had been discussing the POW section for several days before I made my recent edit On July 19 you made this allegation that I have not discussed my edits to the POW section The truth is that I started discussing the POW section 10 days ago on July 10 when I started the section Talk Jihad The issue was subsequently discussed in three lengthy sections of this discussion page before you made this allegation I had been discussing the POW section here for 10 days and yet you said that I did not discuss it at all This is therefore a false allegation on your part Please follow the discussion page more closely if you are going to talk about who has been discussing what and since when Once you are at wikiepdia for long enough you tool will probably get sick of the same type of narrow sighted edits that continually happen by new users I m not sure who or what you are talking about If you believe that my edit on the POW section was narrow sighted then please explain why enlighten us with your apparently wide sighted perspective Maybe this is just me but it seems that ahistorical apologetics are much less dangerous than wholescale demonization and editting articles to say Islam says X thing that modern western society doesn t accept Clearly neither are very good ways to write an article but the latter has more of an agenda and is usually from the type that end up calling Zora or dab or I Muslims Again I am not sure who or what you are talking about I certainly have not denounced anyone s views just because they are Muslims On the contrary I have said before that I wish there were more Muslims editing this article so that a wider Muslim view could represented than the one that is currently represented by the ahistorical apologetics as you call them Having said that I strongly disagree with your opinion that no one on Wikipedia should describe any Islamic practices or laws that modern society Western does not accept We must inevitably discuss what Islam says about various subjects We must report the objective facts about traditional Islamic beliefs in a neutral fashion Neutrality does not mean that if some traditional belief disagrees with the values of modern Western society then it must be not be mentioned You seem to be advocating ahistorical apologetics over neutral and objective facts You have not disproven any of my claims about POWs and Islam but you have insisted that these objective facts are somehow dangerous As for your allegations of wholesale demonization they are unwarrented The way that Islam treats prisoners of war is completely in line with the norms of the medieval era during which these practicies were codified It is a fact of life that Islamic beliefs are deeply rooted in the past and as a result they are sometimes in disagreement with modern secular humanist values If you were truly neutral about this subject then you would not object to the reporting of facts just because the demonstrate a disagreement between traditional Islam and modern secular humanist values It would be the pinnacle of POV pushing if the article were nothing more than ahistorical appolgetics that ommit any and all facts which demonstrate that traditional Islam is at odds with modern secular humanism Wikipedia is not the appropriate place for appologetics Balance is not exactly Muslims say,0.0031121625,0.0036236737,0.0006174501,0.00061713834,0.0016392611

0,The problem is that this mostly happened prior to written history in the region The primary evidence for the Bantu expansion is linguistic relationships and I suppose the absence of Khoi San peoples today where cave paintings suggest they used to be in the past but there is little evidence to determine whether this was a process of military conquest peaceful subjugation or even peaceful amalgamation of the peoples The presence of distinctively Khoi San clicks in both isiZulu and isiXhosa absent in more northern Bantu languages implies to me that the process probably leaned more towards the latter But if someone can come up with reliable sources talking about actual historical evidence of battles that took place between Bantu peoples and Khoi San peoples,0.73731667,0.020343633,0.001330216,0.0005778276,0.0024684232

0,I thank you for your warning and I respect you administrating articles However I do not personally see my edit as vandalism I do admit however that openly saying he is a crazed lunatic was the incorrect way to go about doing things I believe in the merits of wikipedia and that it should strive for truth and excellence There is absolutely no place in the current article about Camping that states science disagrees with his statements Instead the only mentions of disagreement are As a result some individuals have criticized him for date setting and they a ministry believe his entire method of Bible interpretation is flawed If you would like I can pen a section about the invalidity of his arguments from a fact based scientific stance If I cannot do it someone most certainly should Otherwise wikipedia is no more than a medium for which inaccurate science can propagate through the minds of the public When looking at a page such as homeopathy s the second sentence reads The collective weight of scientific evidence has found homeopathy to be no more effective than a placebo Do you not think statements such as those made by Camping should get the same treatment On a final note 24 hours from now nearly the entire article I edited will be proven nonsense The second sentence under this text box states Encyclopedic content must be verifiable Yet despite this the second paragraph of his page states He has used Bible based numerology to predict dates for the end of the world 2 His current end times prediction is that the Rapture will be on May 21 2011 and that God will completely destroy the Earth and the universe five months later on October 21 3 4 He had previously predicted that the Rapture would occur in September 1994 5 The only verifiable thing regarding these predictions is that they are wrong yet that statement is nowhere to be found Tomorrow evening or Sunday if you wish please add the sentence He was wrong about both of his previous predictions to the opening paragraphs of his page,0.372358,0.003556162,0.018386928,0.0011108923,0.0015755151

0,What I appreciate about this discussion is that it is being conducted by people who demonstrate a great deal of concern for the issues involved both the subtleties and the sweep of the issue I believe this is appropriate though admittedly tiring because in legal matters a great deal often hinges on a comma or the inclusion exclusion of the word not or other such maddening technicalities Ergo Shakespeare s famous dictum about lawyers Consejo de Salud Playa de Ponce v Rullan does provide federal precedent and a framework for discussion and debate However the Rullan ruling is not ultimately dispositive of a U S constitutional question or territorial status issue since the U S Supreme Court is the court of ultimate and binding jurisdiction in both of these areas The language of the Rullan ruling did not grant full constitutional privileges to Puerto Ricans living on the island itself as opposed to those living on the mainland The Rullan court stated that Congress today thus must afford Puerto Rico and the 4 000 000 United States citizens residing therein all constitutional guarantees However as stated earlier Puerto Rico is subject to the U S Congress plenary powers under the territorial clause of Article IV sec 3 of the U S Constitution U S Const art IV 3 cl 2 The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States The Rullan ruling occurred in 2008 Three years later in 2011 insular Puerto Ricans have neither U S Congresspersons nor U S Senators and they cannot vote for a U S president Therefore insular Puerto Ricans are not fully enfranchised U S citizens and they have not been extended enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the U S Constitution It is thus clear that in the exercise of its plenary powers the U S Congress has chosen to ignore the Rullan ruling The operative word in this discussion and I understand the frustration on both sides is the usage of the word must in the Rullan ruling As forceful as that word sounds it was mis used by the Rullan court because the U S Congress clearly ignored it Again a lower federal court is not the court of ultimate jurisdiction for the issues addressed by Rullan The U S Congress ignored it Puerto Ricans on the island are not fully enfranchised and therefore do not have enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the U S Constitution I hope this helps your process of consensus I provided it in that spirit,0.011871146,0.003832456,0.0012525553,0.0005697727,0.0017275341

0,selected anniversary An event in this article is a February 26 selected anniversary may be in HTML comment link to Napoleon s portrait The link to Napoleon s portrait at the beginning of this article is a broken link Please fix Thank you Neutrality please This following passage isn t exactly neutral in its tone After all the military record is unquestioned 17 years of wars perhaps six million Europeans dead France bankrupt her overseas colonies lost And it was all such a great waste for when the self proclaimed t te d arm e was done France s losses were permanent and she began to slip from her position as the leading power in Europe to second class status that was Bonaparte s true legacy 10 Please remove Please sign your talk posts and please place new threads at the bottom of the page As to your comment it is a direct quotation and therefore not suppposed to be neutral after all it is in a section of the article that describes conflicting views about Napoleon It is an accurate portrayal of one of those conflicting points of view talk Ah yes but we probably need a quotation from another view that conflicts it Would anyone be able to find one heru nar Some comments regarding France s utter defeat in the Napoleonic Wars should be part of the article nonetheless The fact that France slipped from being the top European power to a secondary level clearly below Britain s and soon also below Germany s and even Austria s is hardly contentious It must be remembered that the Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars came hard on the heels of what appeared to Europe s intellectuals as Britain s final unavoiding loss of great power status following the independence of the U S just six years before the assault on the Bastille Actually France was the dominate continental power until the Franco Prussian war and remains a great power to this day I must respectfully disagree with this latest assertion since France was smaller in size and less influential than both Austria and Russia before the Prussian war Even if one were to concede that it was the main continental power that would imply a loss of status before the Napoleonic Wars it was the main European power including Britain and had beaten combined enemy armies time and time again As for keeping great power status to this day I m sure that that should come as great surprise to the French humiliated by Nazi occupation and resolutely defeated both in Vietnam and Algeria Now it s true they can veto stuff in the UN just like the then underdeveloped island of Taiwan did until 1973 for whatever that s worth Aussiesta who cares about your stupid POV you are telling nonsense nazi humiliation etc pff weren t the US humiliated in vietnam in cuba and now in iraq so they aren t great anymore then right didn t the soviet retreated from afghanistan what about them the german were defeated and occupied in 1918 and 1945 what about them what about the old good british they were wiped by the germans in the campaigns of 1939 Norway then 1940 France and Dunkirk a defeat transformed into a great victory what a joke actually in indochina and algeria the french had 10 times less casualties than their opponents is this a defeat a defeat is supposed to happen when one is loosing a war not when he is winning it these two decolonization wars were wasted by politics the very same happened in the overlooked Suez Crisis of 1956 the british surrendered there they left their french and israeli allies without warning ever heard about the Madagasacar war of independence no why because france smashed the rebellion in a such violent way there are ashamed of no one knows what happened in madagascar in 1946 so it is not in history books moreover france is still a great power with remaining overseas territories and a strong nuclear force the third one in terms of warheads after russia and usa your beloved austrian and german doesn t have so watch your tongue quoting a non neutral POV is just the same as giving your own opinion who do you think you can fool with your francophobic tricks Ah the legendary French manners Brushing insults and rants aside my point remains unchallenged following Napoleon s defeat France slipped,0.012419182,0.66723704,0.0018374721,0.00061400706,0.0016034573

0,What do the three edits Feb 24 have to do with the sock puppetry investigation of COI from 2006 and early 2007 This all seems like a big stretch to formulate a grand conspiracy theory where there isn t any Editors were aware of the COI back when it happened years ago and dealt with it The article is edited and watched closely now Are the only recent edits those three attempted additions to the Barack Obama article Hardly a high crime it seems to me What you re really upset about is that someone did an unfavorable but accurate story about how all attempts to include any mention of controversies or criticisms in the Obama article were reverted News flash many of us have had the exact same experience this editor had If we block users for editing under false pretenses so be it but lots of editors post on other sites about their experiences here This hardly seems like some grand scheme to bring Wikipedia to its knees This check user investigation however and the AfD certainly look like an overeaction that only adds fuel to the fire Klein said he asked someone to make the edits to see what would happen He reported on the experience and those he witnessed of other attempts to edit the page that are easily viewed through the history This hardly seems like something worth making a federal case over The only mischaracterization is yours under false pretenses to incite a block and through off wiki agitation bring disrepute on the project and trigger a major meltdown on the Obama page The fact is the editor in question arranged for an attempt to make a reasonable edit to grotesquely biased article and reported on the experience That it s not favorable to Wikipedia is certainly cause for reflection and consideration of how we can improve our handling of issues like this in the future I know when something messed up is noted on another site and people here are made aware of it there s usually an effort to fix it That happened in this case but the guardians of the Obama page made sure nothing changed So be it If it upsets and embarasses you as it does me do something to fix it,0.07776188,0.066558525,0.0011618779,0.0005764628,0.0023381393

0,I have a lot of sympathies for Mergism but in this case it s a bit tricky A Structurist solution might be better here I would rather see less content and more disambiguation and sectioning on this page with Main article just under the heading of each section What I don t like about this page is that it favors the set theoretic algebraic usage of kernel a bit too much over the other uses such as the integral transform or statistical usages Although the set theoretic usage is more general than the algebraic it is not the case that someone trying to understand the notion in group theory or ring theory for the first time really needs the set theoretic version Usually preimage of the neutral element will do From this point of view kernel algebra is OK although still a bit too chatty particularly in the General Case section The Mal cev algebra section needs help because of the redlinks It also underplays the category theory notion too much compared to the universal algebra notion Again I think that page could be improved with better sectioning Null space is very problematic It is claimed on that page that some people use both that term and the term kernel to denote the zero set of an operator where the latter term is used in its broadest possibly nonlinear sense That coincides with the algebraic version only in the case of linear operators i e linear transformations I confess I have never seen either null space or kernel used synonymously with zero set but have only seem the terms used in the algebraic or in the case of kernel set theoretic senses Maybe I live in a bubble If kernel really is used sometimes in this rather weak sense then this page needs a brief mention of it Again the page Null space itself is rather unstructured Better sectioning could probably fix it Hmm That makes three times I mentioned better sectioning Maybe I really am a Structurist,0.2696725,0.03975617,0.0034925067,0.00059453206,0.0015838601

0,you demanded some facts here you go Dursun Karatas was not born in 1953 but 1950 most of the infos about Dursun Karatas at internet suggest he was born in 1953 it is definately wrong if you look at original Devrimci Sol court documents you will see he was born 27 March 1950 he has enrolled to Universityof Istanbul in 1967 at the age of 17 if he was born in 1953 it means he enrolled to university at the age og 14 which is not possible In 1978 he founded Dev Sol Revolutionary Left precursor of DHKP C 2 Karata group was based in Istanbul 3 this is not a fact the organisation was not based in Istanbul He was representative of Devrimci Yol in Istanbul branch when he established Devrimci Sol splinter organisation from devrimci Yol Even turkish texas ranger that you used his report as a fact states it if you carefully read it Devrimci Sol is not based in Istanbul but all over Turkey especially Adana Izmir etc Karata was jailed after the 1980 military coup In prison a political reorganisation was undertaken The Dev Sol inmates at Bayrampa a prison refused to follow orders and boycotted court invitations This is not true as well They have boycotted the torture and inhumane processes in prison Of course torture is not mentioned at any documents or internet facts but does not mean ut was existed The organisation protested torture in prison and Devrimci Sol started a hunger strikes 4 inmates sorry terrorist for you and turkish texas ranger bearing in mind one of the terrorist lost his life during hunger strike was imprisoned with the accusation of putting up posters in the walls punishable with 6 months imprisonment nowadays lost their lives In prison Karata wrote Hakl y z Kazanaca z a work which included analysis of past mistakes of the Dev Sol movement and lists of enemies of the organization It was published in two volumes in 1989 spanning more than 1000 pages 3 4 5 He did not write it but all Devrimci Sol prisoners As a matter a fact Sinan Kukul prapered the book If you read the book earlier version you would see don t use sun glasses when you read it Lists of enemies of the organisation what a fuck is that there is no such thing in the book their past mistakes the book consisted with Devrimci Sol ideologies its aim etc He escaped from prison in 1989 6 After escaping from jail he went into exile in Europe 4 In 1989 1990 Dev Sol carried out a series of attacks However on July 12 1991 Turkish police was able to dismantle several cells of the organization Karata fled to Europe In April 1992 his wife Sahabat was killed by Turkish police 3 Following the police crackdown on Dev Sol Karata was kidnapped and detained by the second in command of the movement Bedri Ya an on September 13 1993 Karata did however escape from captivity and Dev Sol was divided Karata and his followers reorganized their movement as DHKP C 3 following police crack down very funny second in command bedri Yagan this is a joke not fact Bedri Yagan was experiencin some problems theredore whatever his duties with in the organisation was removed before his action see Devrmci Sol Dava Dosyasi turkish texas ranger mentioned this in his report this is not your fault of course the facts about the organisation and its leader were delibrately changed and munipilated by turkish security forces and its collobraters,0.019615525,0.013957192,0.0060440893,0.00060709345,0.0018259569

0,Minor wording issue about steamboats I m doing some bits of minor copyediting and am stuck on this sentence from the Navigation section The use of steamboats along the river beginning in 1850 There is a footnote to this timeline page which phrases it 1850 Steamboats Columbia and Lot Whitcomb begin regular service on the Columbia River The thing is there were steamboats in regular service on the river before 1850 at least to Fort Vancouver The first was the Beaver steamship which arrived at Ft Vancouver in 1836 I thought about rewording the sentence The regular use of steamboats along the river but that isn t quite right either because the Beaver was in regular use even if its operations were not limited to the river Anyway I can t come up with a way to reword this bit especially given the existence of the footnote which does not mention the Beaver So I m just mentioning it here It is a minor point to be sure but symptomatic of an unfortunate US bias present in many history books and web pages,0.023297641,0.012011832,0.0015099534,0.00057024154,0.0016408312

0,Elen thank you for proving my point Meant seriously in saying so And no I am not finished 1 if Wikipedia is not a publisher of THE TRUTH TM it cannot then call itself an encyclopedia Pillar It can at best and using your own definition here Elen be a publicly accepted repository of publicly accepted facts accepted by the public I said that three times to make a point The repository is only made by publicly accepted parties the facts are also only those the collective shall accept and the amount of verification is similar I point to the Wrestlemania XXVIII dispute This user has decided to use wikia level evidence but since the public has accepted his stand I am not allowed to challenge it And he s lying on top of it And if that and other places I ve attempted to edit are any indication this kind of conduct probably goes on all over the site The problem with the sports organization the BCS case is that if that organization has removed the valid sanction of an event then it creates an inconsistency between verifiability and damnatio memoriae If Wikipedia fancies itself an encyclopedia then it grants a sanction which no longer exists in fact it basically grants a status of fact to something now ruled complete fiction due to the misconduct of one of the teams involved And solely because the public accepts it The problem comes in that Wikipedia as an encyclopedia and I will call this site on that again and again grants a statement of fact on something which is now fiction because the public has decided that the event since it physically took place cannot be reversed even if all evidence points to the fact that it should ve been And yes I will find the same farcical situation in many sports articles And if I must find a published fact for something then personal knowledge becomes irrelevant to the process The Final Fantasy case If we are not going to trust the general public to do research WP OR how do we trust the general public not to manipulate the published facts which see Mania XXVIII Personally speaking generally I don t trust most members of the public far beyond Wikipedia to spell CAT if they are spotted the C and the A How am I going to trust them with a public repository of the facts when they get to determine what is fact and who gets to post it Throwing out Pillar Ah needs to be something the lawyer has signed I assert that hasn t happened in Cena Rock myself One of my ignored claims was that the level of promo of that match is the same as the level of promo in the Daniel Bryan intended cash in And in stating These are some of our rules you openly abdicate Pillar by your own statement The choice is yours not mine because the public apparently gets to determine everything in Wikipedia as I said above How can I carry on an intelligent and informed conversation with someone like ChristianandJericho who basically does not know proper English and chooses to type like a 12 year old girl into a cellphone He probably doesn t even understand what I m saying to him frankly And how can I come to a consensus with a group of people like minded to that At minimum it s going to take a TBAN on pro wrestling and at least two IBANs on the two other users for starters I can probably come up with at least a PBAN on a celebrity for a prosecuted 1998 criminal threat on top of it without even taking initial action on the page,0.04074491,0.01761113,0.0024829572,0.0006673482,0.0016436653

0,If this was a legal Wiki you might have a valid point It s not so you don t Why don t you get a ruling as to whether plain english can be used on this Wiki The lede is supposed to encapsulate the rest of the article which is quiet clear that this was a murder not an accidental natural or judicially sanctioned death I do sympathise and understand that for Sinn F in and the Provisional IRA the current phase of the conflict is about the definition of the conflict itself For the self esteem of the so called republican movement and for the political future of Sinn F in it is vital that its 30 year campaign of violence be remembered as a just war a regrettable but necessary method of achieving a legitimate aim The vile and sordid deeds that run through that campaign may under pressure be described as wrong They may be accepted as mistakes PIRA may acknowledge in the curiously passive language it favours that these things should not have happened But they must never ever be called crimes God forbid kiwiexile at DMOZ moved here from his talk page at Vintagekits request Result of PIRA investigation Why exactly do you think that the views of PIRA should not be fairly represented on Wikipedia in reference to the presumed death of Jean McConville I am rather puzzled as to why you keep excising my new section referencing the PIRA Statement on the the Abduction and Killing of Mrs Jean McConville in December 1972 dated 8 July 2006 by P O Neill Irish Republican Publicity Bureau Dublin Is it just because you are still editing carelessly and without respect to other editor s work by just hitting the revert button when you see naughty words such as Murder and PIRA However I must congratulate your improvement in tone if not the quality and care you take with your actual edits Keep up the improvement kiwiexile at DMOZ,0.12248597,0.021867553,0.0041280086,0.0005811875,0.0017029422

0,Boy this is the most understated thing I ve read here on Wikipedia While the current details about ZCMI are pretty good and the list of stores when the chain wwas closed down is pretty accurate it is hardly an exaustive list of stores that have been in existance Virtually every Mormon community had a version of ZCMI at one time or another and some decidedly non Mormon communities as well The most remarkable being a ZCMI set up in Rapid City South Dakota In addition a huge part of the history of ZCMI is tied directly with the history of Utah including the petition for Utah statehood and the fight between the Mormons and the Gentiles during the territorial days of Utah Part of this history should include how members of the LDS Church would face excommunication if they shopped anywhere except at ZCMI I am not kidding here Several LDS Church members were removed from the church rolls because of this seemingly irrational justification based on modern sentiments Keep in mind that there was a coordinated economic plan to try and push the non Mormons out of Mormon influenced areas and this is really in keeping with other business traditions of 19th Century America as well including Standard Oil and others that would be illegal with current fair trade laws Saying that the LDS Church was a significant influences is hardly doing justice here The LDS Church owned the store lock stock and barrel And the decision to sell ZCMI to May department stores was mainly a way for the LDS Church to get out of that sort of business What is surprising is that is was a subsiderary of the LDS Church for so long making it into the 21st Century The LDS Church has divested itself from other businesses it started back elsewhen like a Sugar Company and a chain of Hospitals and in that context ZCMI is just one of several aspects of life in Utah,0.07871814,0.005009871,0.001987135,0.00062182854,0.0026558368

0,Shuki Well I am glad to see that you are up to speed on everything Wikipedian Here are some of my reactions to your comments UserPZFUN says that he is an admin on his user page which I did look at before the critique see Wikipedia Requests for adminship PZFUN Is that a lie Nowhere do I accuse him of anti Semitism I see that you enjoy twisting around words hmmm what a pity While User PZFUN may well be a lover of Jews that does not mean that he gets a free pass when he does a weird thing to an article about a well known rabbi You may not know it or accept it but the word goy or goyim is considered to be derogatory regardless of what you tell your non Jewish pals in chat rooms again more habitual word twisting on your part I guess What s NOR I cannot read your mind I don t accept any of your thinking about how to handle articles that we know nothing about I suggest when in doubt stay away or else violate the age old saying that Fools rush in where angels fear to tread In Hebrew it s more blunt hedyot kofetz berosh Your statemnt that Again baruch hashem others Jews aren t selfish and don t ignore the rest of WP and baruch hashem many goyim think the same way and contribute to Jewish articles especially w r to structure format etc is hilarious and beyond the scope of this discussion This is Wikipedi and ANYONE can edit do you think I don t know that So your musar yet again is quite amusing I welcome constructive criticism but do know that I am often quite frank and honest as most people who have gone head to head with me know Finally thanks for asking me out but lately I have been into freshly boiled kosher chicken soup more than falafel so you are welcome to try mine any time By the way I don t care who you are in real life,0.7825612,0.008722733,0.004430916,0.0099416645,0.0037497932

0,Moving on from that I too can see an issue with the age of Aldrasto s posts As I stated previously my speciality is Egypt not Rome but the same issue arises with Egyptian sources of the same era Basically scholars from this period have great difficulty in perceiving accommodating or finding language with which to describe beliefs which are not found in Christianity Rather scholars of the period consciously or not tend to describe by analogy with Christianity An absolute classic example is the translation of maa kherau as victorious triumphant or vindicated The words mean a true voice and literally means that what one says will come about but the underlying concept bears no relation whatsoever to the Christian concept of being saved from sin having overcome Satan through faith in Christ The Kemitic Egyptians had nothing that equates to the Christian belief in the need for salvation The reason for the choice of words appears to be connected to Matthew 17 where Jesus drives out a demon that his disciples had been unable to exorcise and tells them that with even a little faith they could command mountains to move about A man who had passed the test of the judgement hall obtained power in Amentet such that what he commanded to happen would happen therefore according to the Christian model this must be because he had in some way achieved the status of a Christian saint,0.3765888,0.009847536,0.0013395752,0.0005723725,0.0015216708

1,A hit list for Jews There is a site called Jew Watch out there I ll let you find the link which specialises in keeping an eye on Jewish activities It is used as a reference site by anti semites the world around Jew Watch makes it a point to make sure that they do not under any circumstances list someone who they cannot confirm 100 is Jewish Stormfront a white supremist web forum uses Jew Watch all of the time The criteria for inclusion on List of British Jews is the same criteria used by Jew Watch It is a criteria designed for anti semites It is a criteria that is aimed in hurting Jews Jewish communities do not have such a criteria They allow anyone to be considered to be a Jew if they have any linkage with the Jewish community through race religion or culture This is the normal criteria that is used If your father is Jewish then per Jewish community standards you are Jewish And so forth Wikipedia as a whole has certain criteria for verifiability But these criteria are not being applied to this list This is being changed purely because this is a Jewish list Whilst Slim Virgin and her friends have claimed that this is in order to stop muslim terrorists this is plainly not true If we are worried about terrorists strapping bombs to their bodies and blowing up Jews then this list shouldn t exist at all And we should especially not try to focus on who are the real Jews Wikipedia are changing their rules purely to push an anti semetic point of view And while Slim Virgin goes around claiming that others who oppose her are neo nazis and ignoring their strong ties to the Jewish community she herself has been unable to answer the questions about her own religious hatred And this is the same person who has supported muslim POV pushers who have written vehement anti semetic text throughout Wikipedia Slim Virgin has been a catalyst for banning people who have opposed these islamofascists Slim Virgin is an anti semite Right now I would encourage deletion of this list It is being run by anti semites and used to harm all Jewish people Until such time as Slim Virgin can be banned from editing this and related pages it is dangerous to continue to have such a page It is encouraging hatred of Jews,0.08451578,0.009686002,0.019789092,0.98485863,0.004938988

1,First point it was not only treated as mental illness but as criminal activity Second point you should only refer to homosexual romance in the lead if there is a section that deals with homosexual romance in the body of the text as the lead is a summary of what is in the body and having ten sources does not count for much unless the terms are unpacked somewhere in the main text All these seem to show is that people like Giddens who is a notable sociologist but no authority on sexuality sexology LGBT studies in general or homosexuality in particular use the term If there were a link to an article Homosexual romance which shows the term can be taken for granted fine otherwise it needs to be dealt with in the article before it can be inserted into the lead Third point my earlier comment about this was made with ironic and humorous intent because I have only come across the term romance used in this context at conferences ironically or critically Just because a term is used in sources does not mean that it can be used in the lead when it is not in the text for example Homosexuals deserve to be executed or tortured,0.015731115,0.007538235,0.041451287,0.3360409,0.001600818

1,ARE YOU FUCKING RETARDED Please do not delete content from articles on Wikipedia as you did to Solaris 2002 film Your edits appear to be vandalism and have been reverted If you would like to experiment please use Wikipedia Sandbox for test edits Thank you Ali What the fuck is your problem Did you even read what I deleted DO you know what the word PLOT means Plot does NOT mean talking about the movie s trailer or what genre the movie it is A plot is a SUMMARY of the movie Read what s in the Plot section of solaris right now you fucking retard and tell me if it really belongs under the section plot or any other section It looks more like trivial facts which are unsupported and should be DELETED as per wiki regulations Here s an example dumb fuck from the solaris wiki page The film essentially ignores the planet which only serves as an anonymous backdrop in contrast to Lem s novel which discusses at length the mysterious phenomena on its surface and the futile human attempts to understand them That is NOT neutrality and has NOTHING to do with the plot Jesus FUCKInG CHRIST Wiki is full of fucking morons Delete that shit,0.7553774,0.5927258,0.016700381,0.6152181,0.99534297
