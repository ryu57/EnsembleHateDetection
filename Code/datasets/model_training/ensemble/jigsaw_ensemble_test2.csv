0,the intent meaning of the book and film The supplmental material on the Blu ray Disk includes reminiscences from Melvyn Douglas s granddaughter about the making of the film It s obvious she has no idea whatever what the film is about The film s meaning is futher confused by Ashby s introduction of the walking on water scene which is not in the book and which he makes sure we get by having Chance thrust his umbrella into the lake It s unfortunate that the film like Chance has become a kind of inkblot onto which people project their own interpretations when it should be obvious to any reasonably intelligent person what Kosinsky is getting at The book doesn t explain the story either Kosinski had too much respect for the reader to do that but it goes something like this Chance is a voyeur who has never actually experienced anything directly Everything he knows is a vicarious experience from watching TV And because his mind is filled with nothing other than what he sees on TV he has never developed an inner dialog that might provide some framework into which he could place his experiences,0.064433366,0.005545547,0.00059600006,0.0005731193,0.0015368251,0.005588004

0,After having a look at the articles in question I am even more convinced that these are very dubious references The SMH article is actually a secondary source with the quote in question coming from tipping com which is an American website I visited tipping com and I can t even find the quote as it was used in the SMH story suggesting that they may have changed their minds in the last couple of years The other article by USA Today seems to be more compelling suggesting a 10 12 tip for Australian restaurants but no tip for other services but again doesn t correlate with my experiences As mentioned above I worry about the quality of the research in the article because it clearly says that New Zealand has no tipping and yet seems to think that Australia which is just over the way from NZ has a totally different tipping custom My experience has been that this is not the case and I would think that the tipping custom that applies in NZ applies equally in Australia,0.012176547,0.0059107663,0.00046076337,0.0005732501,0.0014625813,0.005455338

0,800 1169 1200 New subheading Upon a reminder from Fergananim on this question as raised by him and enthusiastically supported by Scolaire I said I d elaborate a bit here Looking though the discussion again I see I have already tried to say something about it Anyway I think we should follow the now established historiographical division of of 800 1169 To amend problems the limitations from such a division I m thinking the we should to the following Add a couple of sentences either in the lead or in the historiography section explaining why this division is somewhat problematic Mind any division that gets established is problematic for the same reasons Have a solid background section to draw the lines from before 800 into our period I ve slready started that but it might be expanded Have a solid whatever the opposite of background is called in English section drawing lines from our period into the future so to speak Don t treat 1169 as limit written in stone despite being in the title The second synod of Cashel should be discussed here despite being in 1172 the career of Rory O Connor after the invasion should be included etc etc It s not like I m married to 1169 though but maybe we could wait drawing a conclusion on this until I ve gotten around to write something except church history about Ireland after 1050 Might be easier for you to understand my thinking and argue against it if it s in the article and not just in my head Best regards,0.2055698,0.0154129695,0.0008715828,0.0006196986,0.0022085463,0.005541347

0,Well it s not a hoax exactly but it s a prime example of what happens when you start out with a hypothesis and a worthy cause and then try to find any and all evidence that supports it no matter how far fetched or in the case of the current draft blatantly wrong instead of the other way round The problem is while there are examples of androcentricity in language although its effect on cognitive and social processes is debatable the examples she cites are not and she makes the rather fatal mistake of conflating grammatical gender with natural gender and the diachronic with the synchronic analysis of language She also seems to accept an extreme version of the Sapir Whorf hypothesis completely uncritically although the hypothesis is never even mentioned explicitly in the draft It s pretty clear the author has not had any formal training in linguistics or in the languages she has attempted to analyze and appears not to have consulted the rather vast body of academic literature on androcentric language Or perhaps she had but decided ignore the inconvenient conclusions In any case it s fairly obvious why the original version of the book was not published by an academic press and why the revised second version is self published,0.24400708,0.005516701,0.005371271,0.00057632773,0.002413385,0.0054747397

0,Coup not Revolution First off I removed the reference to after Yanukovich fled the country The term fled is loaded and POV To say he left the country is non POV but the statement added zero value in the first place Second let s talk about some English language usage for all the Ukrainians on here specifically the difference between literal and figurative language Revolution A fundamental change in power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time Coup The sudden and illegal seizure of a government usually instigated by a small group of the existing state establishment to depose the established government and replace it with a new ruling body civil or military Let me explain the difference clearly A revolution occurs when forces abolish government power structures This clearly did not occur A coup occurs when one faction of the government seizes control of the existing power structures This clearly did occur There was no revolution in Ukraine There was only a coup This position is non POV and sustainable I recommend Maidan Coup or 2014 Ukrainian Coup but the term Ukrainian Revolution is both POV and misleading Note Above I use the literal definition of Revolution to mean the violent overthrow of government power structures e g the American Revolution Revolution also has a figurative definition of wide ranging change e g the industrial revolution Applying a figurative term that is not literally true is necessarily POV For example neither the Velvet Revolution nor the Orange Revolution were literal revolutions and their names are POV and misleading In both cases these monikers were coined by dissidents I recognize that these are the terms that are widely used to refer to these events and having become widely recognized are appropriate titles in Wikipedia That does not change the fact that they are POV Nor does it change the fact that in this case there is no widely recognized name for these events that would justify such POV naming I reiterate that the appropriate title is Maidan Coup or 2014 Ukrainian Coup 173 79 251 253,0.13365471,0.016326377,0.003755885,0.0006810062,0.0013555365,0.0057370774

0,heading My common usage understanding of the word is that it means statistical information about something or the study thereof My own 1990 dictionary says demographics data resulting from the science of demography and demography the scientific study of human populations especially with relation to their size structure and distribution So on that basis the articles would be correctly titled demographics of and quote lots of statistics It would appear to me that according to my quite large dictionary the article is wrong in its definition of these two terms At the least it should explain that there is a possible different understanding of the terms My own interest was how broad the term demographics is and whether when discussing a population it would include information about the land area climate how wet it is all that sort of stuff which undoubtedly affects and influences the people living there even though it might not be the sort of information collected by modern advertising executives I suspect that a difference in understanding of the terms has crept in because such people are only interested in a subset of the total information I completely agree with you dictionary However the key phrase is the scientific study of human populations Once human population is no longer an essential part of the study as in climate landmass etc which will be the same regardless of population it is no demography I do agree that if climate has an effect on the population e g in the arctic region people tend to protect themselves against cold it is interesting from demography but without such reference not Non families I notice that a lot of Wikipedia articles use some sort of template putting households into four categories had children under the age of 18 living with them were married couples living together had a female householder with no husband present and non families These categories do not add up to 100 for examples see Downers Grove Willowick Ohio etc etc Any ideas about where this came from and how it can be addressed It seems like a category generated as part of a marketing strategy Novickas Generational Cohorts Are those born during the brief 1977 83 period generation less That s exactly what I was thinking what s the deal I ll quote below Generation X cohort born from 1965 to 1976 Memorable events Challenger explosion Iran Contra social malaise Reaganomics AIDS safe sex fall of Berlin Wall single parent families Key characteristics quest for emotional security independent informality entrepreneurial Generation Y cohort also called N Generation born from 1983 to 2007 Seems to be years 1977 through 1982 are wandering generation lost I was recently at a business conference and they where talking about the generations and they referred to the N Generation as the milenials or the milenial generation those who haven t known a time before the computer,0.015247018,0.005809837,0.002317566,0.00058091443,0.0014086391,0.0055197105
0,Cybercobra give it a rest You didn t just consolidate your TODO list you completely removed all evidence of your focus on me and my organization Obviously it appeared inappropriate to you or you would have left it The fact is that if my articles needed fixing amending or deleting other competent editors are capable of doing so You might think that your BOLD stance and following me around makes you a good editor I submit that it is hounding I have edited Wikipedia in the past but I am a busy man Being CEO of a company and president of another doesn t leave a lot of time for going tit for tat with people like you I can only assume that you don t have a lot of pressing issues At any rate I recommend you recuse yourself from my articles and issues and let other people deal with them if they see fit As it stands you have made editing here unpleasant for me and appear to be going out of your way to undermine me and my organization both of which are criteria for wikihounding I can t imagine why you would have such animosity for a person who spends the majority of his time helping people for no remuneration The articles in question are not self promotion we just don t hire people to do this kind of thing like some other charity organisations It seems only logical to me that if our contemporaries in hydrophilanthropy and their CEO s warrant articles than our organization does as well If there are things that could be improved I am sure some people other than yourself are capable of helping out in that regard You say it only takes 2 independent reliable sources Well there are dozens of them and they are not hard to find so if you were truly being impartial of your research into Water Charity and myself you would have found more than enough yourself I am guessing the Washington Post the LA Times and other news agencies from London to Hong Kong the AP Reuters and more are reliable enough If helping a million people doesn t make us notable what does You do realize that water related illness kills more people than all forms of violence put together including war And yet there are Wiki pages for military officers who have only appeared in the media a couple of times that you don t seem to see fit to subject to your scrutiny I really don t have the time or energy to do this with you though If you withdraw your aggressive editing of my posts and go on about your business I guarantee you that someone else will see what you seem to have seen and take up the torch if you were right I would be happy to learn more about how to do all of this correctly and make my edits and articles better But at this point it would be best if it wasn t from you or User Ism Schism whose call for speedy deletion of my article was rejected who you seem perhaps inordinately close to and who also seems to feel the need to follow me around scant minutes after or before you These lessons will have to wait anyway as I have real work to do Should you continue to make me a priority the way you have I will take this to the appropriate venue for harassment complaints and let them decide Erasing me from your TODO list will not cover up what was posted here If you retract your attacks we can erase this entire back and forth and go on about our respective businesses If this is not personal or harassment what do you care anyway,0.22084798,0.037263818,0.004640894,0.0005847196,0.0029817445,0.006002972

0,I m not criticizing you here but I truly don t understand why people from time to time make that comment that is is irrelevant It is a major component of identity far more than say LGBT or political party Anyway the reason why I was compelled to ask the question is that I read an article about her new book regarding Revelations in the New Yorker and it was very anti Christian I then over the following weekend read an article in the Wall Street Journal about this same book and it was more even handed It made the book sound very intriguing and a good work of scholarship So I was using Wiki as a tool to help try and see whether or not it was the author of the New Yorker article or the author of the book who was the bigot or rather whose perspective was being presented in the article So if Wiki said that she is some type of devout Christian or proud of her Christian heritage I would be able to make a better determination of which article was more neutral Or if it said that she was a Cultural Marxist ditto This is precisely what Wiki is there to help us with It might sound mundane but if I had all the information that I needed then I would have been able to make the decision to purchase the book So instead of Wikipedia I had to read the reviews on Amazon Ergo Wiki did not provide all the relevant info I needed Thanks,0.026280511,0.0032547442,0.00102119,0.00062607514,0.0015059952,0.005476716

0,November 2010 UTC I understand Eliot Freidson to be an excellent source and she is cited by Larson as well e g see page 7 8 for a direct quotations for her 1977 essay Health and the Division of Labour ideal type constructions do not tell us what a profession is only what it intends to be my intention is to show how the occupations we call professions organized themselves to attain market power I think we can still use Larson because her book provides more than sufficient coverage to extend the defintion to include these points So if we extend the defintion further using the content of pages x and xi of her book we get A profession is an in a service oriented occupation that is centered on a body of knowledge techniques or skills that have been mastered through training whose members form a community who share a relatively permanent affiliation through professional associations professional schools and a self administered code of ethics The specific attributes of an ideal type profession may vary but the characteristics that make it a distinctive from other occupation are the privalege of autonomy derived from self regulation and the prestige of having special competence Of course we cannot cover all the bases in the lead paragraph this is simply the starting point and these characteristics will be expanded upon subsequently The choice of wording for this summary of Larson is my own but this can be changed if it defective in any way Perhaps we could split the definition between Larson and Freidson or even throw Perks into the mix Again I am open to suggestions on this defintion can be improved upon talk contribs 10 57 3,0.1575571,0.11405446,0.0025037418,0.0005714641,0.0021057285,0.0055573247

0,Is it necessary to have this many pictures of NorthPark Center Most major malls have only one picture of the mall and NorthPark Center being not too notable nationwide has 5 Shrek05 14 31 26 Jun 2006 While NorthPark may not yet be notable nationwide I don t see any reason not to have the pictures of the mall for this reason the mall is the largest in Texas at 2 35 million square feet and one of the five largest in the US according to the International Council of Shopping Centers Consequently the pictures give readers of Wikipedia a view of how a quarter billion dollars was spent in its recent expansion With the 1 4 acre Center Park in the middle NorthPark also becomes the only mall in the nation with a sizeable outdoor area for eating playing or relaxing At one time shortly after its opening by Raymond Nasher the mall also held the distinction of being largest air conditioned building in the entire world picture rendering under Thunderbird looks all wrong The pictures on this page come out all wrong when viewed with Thunderbird I m using ver 1 5 0 4 under Windows XP It looks fine in Internet Explorer v 6 0 same OS Looking at the page source it seems like more of a problem with Thunderbird or the CSS for same but I m no web developer Leaving a note here in the hope that someone more skilled might find it and fix it Fountains It s been probably a year since I last visited but one of the major interior architectural features has always been the fountain with colored lights and another feature I can t describe well sort of a mini pond with a bridge Unusual features worth mentioning very briefly Incidentally having looked at the existing pictures only one of which is at all attractive or unique I think we d do better to find or snap a good picture of the fountains instead I d have to look into whether there are any restrictions on taking pictures I once had problems taking pictures inside a supermarket for my Spanish class they thought I was some sort of corporate spy Lacoste If I can afford it it s secondary Gucci Gucci is located in the Galleria and not in NorthPark It is moving to NorthPark Preceding unsigned comment added by talk contribs Major Edit 3 26 2007 Staff Email I contacted NorthPark Center staff asking them to release some images of the mall into GNU license since the mall recently underwent construction and could use some new photos What I got in return was neither photos nor permission but a revised version of the Wikipedia article deemed to be factually correct by their staff A full copy of the email is provided Most of the email has been transplanted into the article with a few exceptions as some parts did not meet Wikipedia s standards of notability or NPOV The biggest omission is the list of stores exclusive to NorthPark The information does not appear to be notable The introduction claims NorthPark Center is one of the top five shopping mall s in the United States but it appears to be outdated because the List of largest shopping malls in the United States would rank the mall as in the US based on Gross Leasable Area The infobox has been updated to match up with the International Council of Shopping Centers data rather than the figures currently displayed on NorthPark Center s website There s still a lot that violates NPoV here I slapped the neutrality tag on it GPS coordinates I think the coordinates are 32 868594 96 773200 for someone who understands the GPS template Preceding unsigned comment added by 20 132 68 133 Largest in Texas User Aidenfash continues to claim that NothPark is the largest in Texas yet the sources provided by the ma,0.0032083506,0.078950986,0.0011246878,0.0005766389,0.0014343932,0.005556945

0,Wikilinks How territorial of you to undo all my wikilinks just so you could put them all back yourself Some of them you didn t even put back right hence the friendly notice left on your talk page you still have some DAB links left How is this clearer and who does that Who will purposely undo what a previous editor didwhich actually helped the pagejust so they could micromanage a page and do it all over again themselves but worse I don t get it I followed your dance style on the card rule and I added wikilinks which weren t there before We were on the SAME SIDE Snow We both want a better page Pay attention If you were thinking clearly instead of obsessing over a page you think belongs to you all you would have had to do after I originally added the wikilinks is fix mambo tango b boying and kalinka they all linked to disam pages Then everything would have linked fine Instead you undo everything I linked Then you re add links all back and end up creating more disambiguation links than what existed before You even linked to some pages which aren t even helpful Example you changed Tap dance back to Tap dancing and Krumping back to Krump The only reason why I changed the way the words ended in the first place was to provide a link directly to their respective articles instead of to the redirects not because I m being subjective But you change the links back so that they point to the redirects It s not like your helping people in their understanding All you did was link those dance styles back to redirect pages instead of to the actual articles How petty is that Take Bollywood for another example Are you aware of the fact that Bollywood dance redirects to Hindi dance songs Not to mention the fact that there s also a big huge original research banner at the top of that article How is this article going to help someone understand Bollywood dance better than the Dance in India article which is where I linked it to before you reverted my edit If you really didn t like it pointing to that article you could have at least linked it to Bollywood song and dance this time Either way at least people reading those pages would understand the dance better than reading an article about Hindi dance songs which has very few citations Stop being selfish and think about the readers Final thoughts By the way regardless of how the show presents street dance old school is two words and breaking will always be hip hop dance considering it is one of the pillars of hip hop culture That s a fact and not subjective Read a book watch a documentary or educate yourself some other way if you don t want to hear me out I m going to change old school back to two words because it s good grammar I m also going to remove electric boogie take African out of the jazz dance group and fix all the disambiguation links you added Then I ll either make pas de duex it s own row again or put lyrical hip hop back beside hip hop Or maybe do both Or maybe not even touch them I haven t decided yet since you have a problem my editing except for the last option I don t know what you would settle with Any other changes I make won t be without good reason I think I ve demonstrated that by my long winded response to your comments If it kills you to see me make these edits again then go ahead and revert them At that point I ll just go to WP RFC and solicit the opinions of people who don t care about either of us or SYTYCD because I m not about to argue back and forth on this talk page with you considering that you don t WP OWN the page you have no sources and more importantly you have no WP CONSENSUS about a rule you made up which you yourself reneged on My ip 132 3 17 68,0.29099825,0.13448767,0.001800561,0.00064127607,0.006963819,0.006391542

0,Removal of images of nudes To editor 96 60 28 170 To be honest you raise a good point however it is my opinion that any children who may see these images of classic paintings will not only be enriched by them but also they will probably not see the nasty side that some adults might see When I was a child I saw great beauty is such works of art And I also saw great beauty in a Van Gogh or a Rembrandt or any number of works by great artists Sculptures of David Venus de Milo and other nude or scantily clad subjects are a part of this world And I might add they are some of the better parts of this world Since this is an article about Truth I would ask you to honestly state your real concerns here Are you worried that some child will see these nudes and they will cause him to become a pervert Is it your concern that children will be permanently marred by being exposed to nudity Children as you may know have very short attention spans They revel in one fascinating thing after another rarely staying with one thing for any length of time In any case it is a violation of Wikipedia s Neutral point of view policy as well as the content preservation policy to remove works of art such as these for no reason other than it is one person s point of view that the nudes should not be viewed by children If these images are offensive to you then by all means use your mouth quickly and click on another article There are several other articles related to Truth that can be found in the Navbars near the bottom of the article Best of everything to you and yours diss cuss,0.016497217,0.09934701,0.0019949232,0.0005875805,0.0021106144,0.0055409498

0,I agree that Stevietheman s suggestion is the most appropriate to implement JHP if you re talking about the 14 54 27 June 2007 24 209 30 113 edit entry that I reverted it is because the content was taken directly from the Incidents page without any regard for either a including the references themselves or b not following the WP BLP policy that was taking place over on that page regarding this specific incident If you re talking about the 22 32 2 July 2007 Realkyhick edit entry that I reverted it s because the entry contained information that was already outdated by information that was updated in the Incidents page and the link to the Incidents page was also removed by Realkyhick at that time If you re talking about your edit from the 29th that was just a copy of the same info from the Incidents page poorly included and badly placed in the article while we all agree that there should be some mention of the incident including it in the intro section isn t really appropriate either especially as it in essence duplicated information that was posted further down the page Yes I know that you ll disagree with the in essence part but go with me on the concept As for an official WP policy there are guidelines listed in the help section on what makes a good article I like to think that the Incidents articles fall under WP BETTER,0.0030177603,0.0038053652,0.0015690484,0.0005701575,0.0026695633,0.0054563605

0,Caught in the merge crossfire Thanks Just to say thank you for your help dealing with my opposition to the merger proposal for Bispham High School Arts College which linked into the Portsmouth and Southampton merger proposals simply because the proposer who appears to have been using these merger proposals to make a point rather than discussing them anywhere chose the school seemingly at random after they saw it mentioned on the Wikipedia Schools project talk page Not being sure what to do about this your help in supporting my opposition to the merger and removal of the tag has been really useful and much appreciated Talk You are welcome it is a shame that Bispham High School Arts College got caught in the crossfire I know how difficult it is to put together an acceptably cited entry for a school especially one with a short history having spent the best part of a day on Admiral Lord Nelson School Portsmouth back when the Portsmouth nonsense first started I must say the infobox and logo make the page look very professional I must do the same later in the week You might find these links useful assuming I have the right school inspectionNumber 194298 32 5C 5Cschool 5C 5C119 5C 5Cs10 119734 20020306 pdf 1437244 00 html fuseaction summary 119734 103857 Have a good week,0.0053582033,0.013744117,0.00094193325,0.00057846407,0.0014760661,0.005463714

0,Apologies I never got back to you properly about Wynton and Haydn and now I fear I never will sorry Briefly I just felt that it was a bad example because in my view it both overestimated the impact of Wynton s recording and underestimated how popular and well known the concerto already was before Wynton was even heard of It seems to give a status to that one recording which is not due I speak as a trumpet player who very much admires Wynton as a player but is very suspicious of the hype which sometimes attends him and which seems to ignore the many fine recordings of this piece which have been made before and after that one It s not a situation like Gorecki 3 or the loathsome The Piano It just from where I am sitting entirely lacks the feeling of a crossover It s just one good recording among many of a very popular piece LOTS of non classical specialists could whistle the 3rd movt tune while Wynton was still at school I m sorry to do this to you as you now won t have a chance to argue with me but it s the best I can manage right now Best wishes Neville 07 39 16 Jul 2004 UTC,0.00916527,0.006367428,0.0014026834,0.0005775363,0.0013621942,0.0054978244

0,The problem of LTI is difficult because many BSEEs forget what it is after leaving class So we have to be very grammatically careful to write clearly for even a technical audience Memristors are linear when solving a circuit at one point in time which is an important bit of linearity Essentially LTI theory developed to describe what Fourier Laplace transforms and LCR circuits and can do So it s surprising to an EE that a fundamental passive element would not work in that theory But it s not important to a non EE So we have to phrase it such that a non EE will gloss over and an EE stops and says what does that mean again Because as you can see on this talk page a lot of people are getting confused on this particular point,0.056067273,0.047021225,0.002992718,0.0005892287,0.0014530191,0.0055158692

0,27 July 2007 UTC Although I understand your arguments I am surprised you don t understand mine I don t find it labyrinthine or at least not particularly so Not more than many other events and aspects concerning the Beatles Nor is the interpretation in question in any way obscure since it can be taken from any number of texts on the Beatles However though I support the original author s intent here I guess you and I are going to have to agree to disagree over this point for now At some point however I will source his her statements as soon as I find time to delve into the texts just because I would appreciate reaching some sort of accord with you Until then I don t think we will make much more progress on this The problem with something like this is that there is no absolute truth But to me discrediting the original author s intent is like a dog biting its own tail From wikipedia re Abbey Road being the final album or not Abbey Road is the eleventh official album recorded by The Beatles Although its release preceded that of Let It Be it was the last album to be recorded After the near disastrous sessions for the proposed Get Back album later retitled Let It Be for release Paul McCartney suggested to producer George Martin that the group get together and make an album just like the old days just like we used to free of the conflict that began with the sessions for The White Album Martin agreed to this if the band would be the way they used to be In their interviews for the Beatles Anthology series the surviving band members stated they knew at the time this would very likely be the final Beatles product and therefore they agreed to set aside their differences and go out on a high note re the position of The End The End was initially intended to be the final track on Abbey Road but it is followed by Her Majesty In the first practice mix of the medley constructed on 30 July Her Majesty followed Mean Mr Mustard etc This labyrinth has already been walked through a thousand times by a thousand people 09 58,0.008736291,0.007813974,0.000601887,0.0005701451,0.0014833338,0.0054511926

0,2005 UTC This periodization of Proto Slavic PS is not generally accepted However most scholars agree that the PS period lasted for 2 000 years or so It is impossible that the language would not have been changing for so long That is why reconstructed forms labelled Proto Slavic are very various indeed supnas supnu sunu and s n a dream or sleeping can all be termed Proto Slavic There is not even the agreement when the period ended Some give even 600 AD as the final date after which individual languages existed others say that OCS ca 850 AD was still a literary form of the latest Proto Slavic of course with strong dialectal local features And there do not seem to be any real basics for any periodization of PS Specialists argue even on relative chronology of some language phenomena inc phonetic changes for example some would see the sequence as us u u i e first changing and losing of s next vowel reduction while others would assume as us s i e first vowel reduction then loss of final consonants And to say nothing of the absolute chronology The situation is even more complicated when we took into consideration that most of the literature on the subject is not English and the authors use terms which are not strict renderings for English Proto Slavic and Common Slavic In fact in Slavic languages there exists the term praslavyanski or silmilar where pra means the same as great in great grandfather praded or similar This term should be translated as Old Slavic then Besides the term protoslavyanski Proto Slavic refers at least in some sources to the early period of the Slavic language commonwealth less or more equal to Schenker s EPS and finally the Russian term obshcheslavyanski Common Slavic Polish og lnos owia ski with the same meaning refers to features which are present in each modern Slavic language rather than to their common ancestor Anyway I see no reasons for keeping two different articles one on Proto Slavic the other for Common Slavic whatever these terms mean 12 18 13 August,0.0054259216,0.0033968461,0.0056594308,0.0005794051,0.0017060334,0.0054803137

0,OMG you are an imbecile Seriously Let s go over this one last time on the remote chance you might finally understand the difference between fact and opinion I rewrote the contribution using ONLY information that I found on the Internet that supported the contribution I did not add anything to the story that could not be verified through a reliable source YOU on the other hand wrote a contribution that DID add content to the story that could NOT be verified through a reliable source making it YOUR OPINION You said things like when a neighboring police agency was needed and requested by the chief of police to intervene in the criminal conduct of Arvada s police force This is libelous because you accuse the Arvada Police Department of criminal conduct when no criminal conduct has been proven in a court of law Even the officer who is alleged to have done the hitting has been found not guilty by your peers Because no one is convicted in the link you provide or ANY link ANYWHERE on the Internet it is your OPINION If you had used the phrase ALLEGED criminal conduct you would be more on track You also wrote Arvada s city council had chosen not to intervene in the previous criminal conduct of several members of the Arvada police despite a cost to the city of close to half a million dollars defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone during a period of budget crises The close to half a million dollars was NOT spent defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone The money was spent settling OUT OF COURT so that the accusations had no opportunity to be proven as fact A criminal is someone who has been CONVICTED of a crime So there cannot be criminal actions unless someone has been convicted of a crime There CAN be alleged questionable actions which is what you should have written When you post hateful things about others that is just your opinion that opens you up to a LIBEL SUIT If you do it in a blog and you make it clear that you are expressing your opinion and not facts you can say whatever you like there without much fear of libel But when you post to a site whose premise is encyclopedic content you cannot just post what you THINK You must post what can be VERIFIED Do you understand this very basic principle Please read it again if you don t because I m done trying to educate you Definition of libel I encourage you to visit the link and read all its contents is libel htm Libel involves false statements knowingly presented as fact In the United States opinion is protected as a tenant of freedom of speech falling outside the purview of libel Citizens retain the right to comment on public figures and entities including government and officials Entertainment parody editorials and criticisms that may arguably misrepresent facts are not libelous so long as they are presented for amusement or stated as mere opinion From How to prove libel There are several ways a person must go about proving that libel has taken place For example in the United States the person first must prove that the statement was false Second that person must prove that the statement caused harm And third they must prove that the statement was made without adequate research into the truthfulness of the statement These steps are for an ordinary citizen You are unable to be objective about the content you are writing because you have a personal emotional feeling or opinion about it Because of this you HAVE NO BUSINESS contributing to Wikipedia and it s my OPINION that you should be banned from doing so I ve made several contacts on this issue and am waiting to hear back,0.7762454,0.04796348,0.0059147626,0.004721091,0.0020185872,0.015805805

0,Hmmmm are you suggesting stripping discussion of the pentarchy in the lead or are you suggesting different phrasing if so what do you recommend My understanding is that it was Constantinople s position that Rome objected to which granted was at the core of Justinian s pentarchy but not the idea of the patriarchate system as a whole Even so though it s not like Rome pulled out of future councils or in any other substantial ways severed itself from the emperor at that time In other words it is certainly true that there were many violent disagreements some of which led to temporary schisms but to my understanding Justinian s system even if not everybody liked it became a practical reality one that indeed helped fuel the fire that pushed Rome further and further away,0.10965876,0.0037536446,0.0044948603,0.0005738578,0.0021473793,0.005469524

0,Correction I was blocked because you made allegations you were not even remotely able to substantiate in the subsequent discussion Accusing someone of making personal attacks without providing a justification for your accusation is also considered a form of personal attack applies here If I sticked to that rule I would need to start an investigation on this faked block and its violation resulting in a sanction against you but this just would be another skirmish that would distract the original need to free this article of biased and one sided passages A prime example is the Discovery section that actually consist of pointing out unpreparedness and to say in a roundabout way that Scott would be the only one to blame for that no mention that he wasn t even involved in all aspects of the preparation and that contemporaries like Hugh Robert Mill librarian of the Royal Geographical Society said Scott if anyone could bring order out of the chaos which had overtaken the plans and preparations Concealing positive statements like this and only pointing out things diminuishing Scott s achievements is not only embezzling to the reader but greatly contradicts the requirements of neutrality in a encyclopaedic context The same goes for the embarassingly biased and ashamedly one sided Controversies article that deliberately tells not even half of the whole story and intentionally conceals all arguments from the other side of the spectrum This article hadn t been linked for ages and out of some emotional situation he recently just added it to the Main Scott article despite its violations of neutrality and biasedness The most logic thing to not let this article s neutrality be further undermined I removed the link Ruhrfisch fought tooth and nails to prevent me from doing this which once again shows that he s not interested in adding any positive aspects concerning the person Robert Falcon Scott whatsoever and tries with a vengeance to prevent anyone from doing so It is no accident that from my edits which included mentioning aspects of misfortune like the extraordinarily base character of some of the ponies comments about the man hauling or statements from contemorary explorers all of these have been removed by this single user And then he even has the nerve to accuse me of disruptive editing ROFL And while I m blocked he reverts another 3 edits of mine without any justification whatsoever or opening a discussion or anything I don t see how this is to be called either fair minded polite correct neutral or whatsoever These are acts of impudence aim at concealing facts and greatly undermine this article s neutrality and encyclopedic value And Ruhrfisch no what you explained to me that the undo button had completely disappeared because of a conflict with another edit is not true as I have been told by Wikipedia Foundation that Undo buttons does not disappear at all regardless whether there s a conflict or not You just can t click it but it stays,0.30106872,0.021278251,0.0034758647,0.00057047635,0.0014112655,0.005489209

0,Wahabi and terrorism I have added this heading with neutral and verifiable sources which is most missing point from this Article Wahabi relationship with Terrorism Wahabism Saudi Arabia s dominant faith is an austere form of Sunni Islam and Its explosive growth began in the 1970s when Saudi charities started funding Wahabi schools and mosques 22 Professor Bernard Lewis a leading scholar of Islam has noted that the Wahhabis are to Islam what the Ku Klux Klan is to Christianity They can be accused of hijacking Islam 23 The Wahabi movement is directly involved in terrorist activities all over the World The Al Qaeda and a lot of recent Islamic terrorists such as Osama Bin Laden Ayman Al Zawahiri and Abu Musab Al Zarqawi have been inspired by Wahabism 24 The regular Bombing of shrines in Pakistan and Killing of Sunnis and Shias is done by Sipah e Sahaba and TTP Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan 25 Wahabism is associated with the removal of head stones from the graves of the members of the family of the Prophet Muhammed and the desecration of Islamic shrines in Hejaz and Karbala in Iraq and the struggle for power in what was yet to become Saudi Arabia Once its followers took power they did whatever they could to destroy Ethiopia For example the secessionist war in Eritrea 1958 1991 which was designed to make Ethiopia land locked was largely financed by Saudi Arabia Likewise Saudi finance made it possible for Somalia to invade Ethiopia in 1977 1978 The Saudi authorities may deny this but it is widely documented 26 edit In Pakistan The JamatudDawah Lashkar e Jhangvi Lashkar e Taiba and Sipah Sahaba are main terrorist organization of Wahabi movements These terrorist organizations have been banned by Pakistani government but are working by their new names Arab states especially Saudi Arabia and GCC states have been funding extremist Deobandi and Wahabis in Pakistan since the Afghan Jihad Pakistan has became a battleground between Saudi Arabia funded Deobandi and Wahabis and Iran funded Shia causing deaths of thousands of innocent Muslims 27 edit In India Wahhabism an austere puritanical interpretation of Islam promoted by Saudi Arabia is making deep inroads into Kashmir due to the efforts of the Jamiat Ahl e Hadith which calls itself a religious and welfare organisation Kashmir s non Muslim minority too views the Wahhabi ingress as a conspiracy to Talibanise Kashmir The Taliban had also sprung from Pakistani madrassas funded by the Wahhabis says former Kashmir University professor Kashi Nath Pandita 28 If any Wahabi supporter or any objective supporter has any doubt regarding this content he may discuss here,0.66344273,0.039287087,0.16810828,0.0007720025,0.009588537,0.0070381523

0,October 2008 UTC Need for sympathy towards the too many anti Christian violence articles There is a question of garnering donations from America and Europe with sob stories of anti Christian violence involved in the large number of articles being posted on anti Christian violence in India with seperate articles for each and every incident for whatever reason on anyone bearing a seemingly Christian name This is good for India also because it brings in foreign direct investment I have therefore decided not to induce any more NPOV in this and similar articles because they are only belly filling exercises by resourceful missionaries and as such deserve sympathy 09 45 11,0.012988945,0.023661213,0.014490445,0.0006044262,0.0013089328,0.0056157536

0,POV Tag Vandalism David Starr has re posted the POV alert tag on this page I do not feel he ever fully addressed my questions He is asserting that the page shows overwhelming bias in some way according to him there are only two specific single line instances that he cites of bias on the page both in the bio This does not a biased page make I have clearly refuted both of these claims at length with no response despite repeated requests from Starr 1 The garbage passage is balanced with an explanation from a Da spokesperson The source is quoted phrase is neutral and source scholar Georg Feuerstein is not in dispute by Starr The mention is crucial because it explains the controversial aspect in first line of lead and period is alluded to in Adidam apologies for controversial earlier behavior and in the numbers of lawsuits news articles and analysis by authorities linked to and discussed in Da page Also further explained by Da himself in Crazy Wisdom section in teaching 2 Mention of 1986 breakdown Divine Emergence This is a significant event as attested by Adi Da press Source is not biased all mentions of events are phrased neutrally within basic journalistic standards Balanced with Adi Da self assessment as personally significant event about which an entire book was written 3 Undue weight was shown to be unreasonable as each line is short without subjective exposition On balance throughout page all potentially controversial material in every case sourced cited and neutrally phrased is far outweighed by neutral info and Da self assessment Every potentially controversial mention is carefully contextualized and phrased to reflect source and balanced with an alternate explanation In every case Source disputes 1 Gurdjieff Journal no specific instances of bias are alleged by Starr from this source Starr is simply questioning the source without saying why it is an issue Did not address my point that source is only used because it summarizes bio info from Da Rudi and Siddha Yoga accounts No bias is reflected in WP entry no has any been revealed And Starr has failed to show how magazine is biased or self published simply making assertion that it is a competing religious organization which is simply unproven there is no Gurdjieff church or organization 2 Lake County News source has been used for other articles Starr only questions it for single mention that he subjectively finds to his dislike the Divine Emergence passage He has not worked to find alternative source that would allow the material about a significant event to remain Source has been found acceptable to all other editors in past months as demonstrated by its repeated use Starr cannot singly enter now and discount source when not showing WP guideline that effectively discounts it only his own subjective analysis of the quality of the contact page on their website All other editors including myself have been involved in give an take on this page making allowances and corrections for each other even yesterday I made changes to accommodate other editors including Starr I do not feel that Starr is meeting this standard and in particular completely failed to address my repeated specific requests Because of this I am removing the POV tag as vandalism and an attempt to discount page I have requested third party review and perhaps further dispute resolution,0.03776726,0.019071132,0.003148039,0.000583294,0.009617106,0.0055292514

0,Janbwade The statements you question are all verified in the body of the article from secondary and primary sources The primary source is the Watchtower organization itself If anything this source is biased towards itself which is understandable The other sources are diverse and unbiased and peer reviewed Since these secondary sources are reviews of data then bias is not only unlikely but virtually impossible So if anything we can say none of the sources are hostile toward the Watchtower organization or to the community of Jehovah s Witnesses Hence I fail to see veracity in your complaint I recommend that you consider the sub heading Acceptance within Jehovah s Witness community within the article about Jehovah s Witnesses and blood transfusion If you dispute its content and sources then please specify exactly why Also please keep in mind that due to 1 the Watchtower organization s policy to have JWs shun JWs who conscientiously accept transfusion of blood products it forbids and 2 your reputation as an ardent supporter of Watchtower policies then it is expected that JWs who disagree with the Watchtower s blood doctrine would not you access to their choices and HIPPA regulations are a powerful incentive for clinicians to keep patient preference highly confidential particularly when it is specifically requested Hence your personal experience is likely of little if any value in addressing the issue of your complaint,0.18749031,0.005437021,0.004589043,0.00059300073,0.0045191403,0.005721837

0,Seems like implying that someone who has different polices is opposed to BSA is a collolary to the principle shoved at me when I tried to include rpoportionality numbers Here s the quote Let me give this an example let s say I m talking about the 2004 US Presidential Election Suppose I say this Only 60 million Americans out of the 300 million Americans total voted to re elect President Bush This sentence is technically true and it is technically factual but it is also misleading and unfair to President Bush The sentence implies that while only 60 million supported the President the other 240 million didn t vote for him This is technically true but it s totally unfair and misleading The fact is most American s don t vote and the majority of those 300 million were undecided not opposed to Bush And as we know Bush was in fact the most popular candidate So to say 60 million out of 300 million total supported Bush is simply very very misleading even if every word of it happens to be true So saying others with different policies are opposed to BSAis the same kind inferrence some were vehemently against,0.05484628,0.0173225,0.004039244,0.0005929131,0.0015627943,0.0055579734

0,re Gillian Hiscott Thank you for your message at my talkpage Firstly I would point you toward the discussion that resulted in the article first being deleted Wikipedia Articles for deletion Gillian Hiscott Any text in blue is a link to another Wikipedia page for instance WP BIO takes you to the page where the criteria for the inclusion of biographical articles and in the above instance there was the conclusion that there was insufficient evidence that the article as written reached the standards required I redeleted because it appeared that the decision made at the review was simply being disregarded and I blocked for much the same reason Primarily the basis of inclusion of articles on Wikipedia is determined by whether they are notable and this notability can be verified by the use of independent and reliable references and on biographical articles this is more rigorously applied than normal since the there are real life consequences for the subjects if the content is wrong or maliciously included However the high setting of standards does mean that even good faith creation of an article that cannot be referenced to a reputable third party source will fail and there is the question of whether a subject that cannot provide those references is of sufficient stature to be included As I said perhaps the best course of action to take is to read through the WP help pages Help Contents Editing Wikipedia Help Contents Links and especially Help Contents Policies and guidelines are good places to start and see if you can create an article in your userspace which conforms to the guidelines,0.038141876,0.0058729616,0.0022545261,0.0005737511,0.0014092119,0.0054759546

0,Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the city Dear Salvio You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds There is a constant undermining of the city s Greek identity i e whenever a Greek flag that is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views On the other hand such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non recognised internationally illegal self proclaimed state of the so called TRNC It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals that strategically reached the level of administrators deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on North Nicosia that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w r t the city The TRNC is illegal not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour In the light of all of this I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self Furthermore I do not wish to participate in an encyclopedic project that is totally biased and discriminatory,0.82225126,0.004318639,0.015156037,0.29386324,0.0021574344,0.0067707296

0,UTC And I just wanted to mention that my mother also had a surgery in 1996 for her epilepsy and it lessened her seizures to only one a day and at around the same time everyday I think the surgery did wonders in improving her life However she experienced a Sudden Unexplained Death in epilepsy in January of 1998 about two years after her surgery I believe the surgery had nothing to do with her death it was two years later how could it be and that seriously the surgery she had really did wonders for her She was able to enjoy spending more time with us kids and less time worrying about if she was going to have a seizure any second My mother s case was not hereditary She has a very odd case They were never sure EXACTLY what caused her to have epilepsy literally her entire life well she was about 8 or 9 months old at the time of her first ever seizure but my grandparents believe it has to do with a head injury at the time of her birth But once again they were never sure 03 49 28 August 2009,0.020297676,0.004948392,0.0013117741,0.000578704,0.0016330051,0.0055594784

0,I don t get particularly upset about AD CE and as far as I know you don t either Poor Chooserr does on the other hand and has been blocked for edit warring a few times But the battle as to when the Gospels were written and as to whether Jesus really existed is being fought at Jesus as well as at Historicity of Jesus with one of the same editors leading the battle I only came across the dispute quite recently although the article was on my watchlist as a vandalism target This editor insists on writing jesus quotation marks and lower case all over the talk page to make the point that Jesus wasn t a real person and for a while he was adding a paragraph saying that there was no evidence that he had ever existed I do recall reading that the agreement was that if articles already had CE they shouldn t be changed to AD and if they had AD they shouldn t be changed to CE I haven t found the relevant page I think the dating of the Gospels is more important I have Robinson Tresmontant and Carmignac in the house but have only skimmed through them They as you know argue for an early date I can never work out how reliable Brown is supposed to be Father Peter Straviskas whom I trust seems to think highly of him Father William Most whom I also trusted he s dead now considered him very unreliable Going down to dinner now Aurelie talk,0.028023725,0.1256887,0.002747638,0.0005889536,0.0048120064,0.005557755

0,Hi thanks for your comments they will definitely be helpful in getting the article to a point where it s appropriate for more general audiences and not just trained linguists To answer some of your specific questions f mhar has u in some dialects because the rule that mid vowels are raised to high vowels before nasals including the formerly nasal mh applies to in many dialects This reminds me that I didn t discuss that raising in the article at all so I ll add a new section about it presently F and bh mh v are often pronounced with the bilabial fricatives instead of the labiodental f v Unfortunately the published sources aren t very specific about when which versions are used The same is true for palatal vs palatovelar not that there s a huge difference between the two in the first place any individual speaker probably uses both interchangeably without even hearing a difference Sometimes the standard orthography does a very poor job of representing a particular dialect s pronunciation of a word In the dialect I got the info from scanradh happens to be pronounced as if spelled scamhradh The pronunciation of cam is kaum per the discussion of lengthening diphthongization before fortis sonorants Exactly how the fortis and lenis sonorants differ changes from dialect to dialect as I tried to show in the chart There isn t one unified pronunciation of the two types Images of the vocal tract like the one you link to are fine for consonants but not much use for vowels as the differences between nearby vowels are too slight to be easily seen in them Also they belong more on the pages about the sound in question than in this article I m sorry if your heart sinks at the word largely but this page really isn t intended to help you get from spelling to pronunciation That s what Irish orthography is for This page is for describing how Irish is pronounced by native speakers regardless of the spelling The realizations of sh are also discussed at Irish orthography though some discussion of the alternations between h and would probably not be amiss here I ll see what I can find about str oc There s no epenthesis when cn gn is pronounced cr gr because epenthesis is found only in Munster and cr gr for cn gn is found only outside Munster at abstract level vowel initial words all begin with either a front or back glide that triggers either palatalization or velarization Is there a way to determine what is being triggered in each particular case Well from the orthography yes if it starts with e or i palatalization is triggered if it it starts with a o or u velarization is triggered but from a purely phonological point of view no It has to be included as part of the lexical information of the word Alternation in the table refers to the fact that some forms of a word e g the nominative case have one sound e g a long vowel with other related forms e g the genitive have another sound e g a short vowel gr,0.029545235,0.009045705,0.0007876888,0.0005760806,0.0016160782,0.0055282866

0,US States name game is a terrible example Due to the limited number of states this game would be over almost as quickly as it started Why Consider Over 40 21 out of 50 of states end in the letter A Of the four states that start in A three Alabama Alaska Arizona also end in A and the fourth Arkansas would lead you to either South Carolina or South Dakota both of which end in A and thus you d be stuck in an endless loop of 6 states from which you cannot escape This loop is almost completely unavoidable The example given in the article is already stuck in this loop Almost as many 18 states start with a letter that no other state ends in So the only way these states would ever come up in gameplay is if you started with them Of these states we also have the only state ending in a T Connecticut and the only state ending in an H Utah Thus you can add Hawaii Tennessee and Texas to the list of states that will almost never come up The only way you won t end up stuck in the endless A loop is if you somehow land on one of the five states Delaware New Hampshire Tennessee unlikely as seen above Kentucky and New Jersey that end in a letter no other state starts with at which point the game would be over There are numerous other pitfalls consider Ohio You could either loop endlessly on Ohio or go to Oklahoma thus falling into the A loop or you could go to Oregon From there you could go to Nebraska Nevada North Carolina and North Dakota all falling again into the A loop Or you could hit New Hampshire or New Jersey both game enders or New Mexico which just takes you back where you started or finally New York New York then leads to Kentucky ending the game or Kansas falling via South Carolina or South Dakota back into the A loop yet again Maybe Nations of the World would be a better example There s more of them for one thing though still quite a few ending or starting in A and again a large number of which both start and end in A so the loop still exists but it s larger and easier to get out of Also most letters of the alphabet are represented at the beginning or end of at least one country so you d be less likely to get stuck and there aren t so many of them which could never appear A few exist can t think of any countries ending in J V or Z sorry Jordan Vietnam Venezuela and Zimbabwe probably more but I d have to do a more thorough search Anyhow maybe I m crazy for noticing stuff like this but I thought it was worth mentioning,0.010149297,0.9547041,0.0041210046,0.00058308174,0.0015689761,0.0055856435

0,Please read discussion comments about the expert article on the get conflict below For the religious process see Get divorce document A get or ghet is a Jewish bill of divorce which is supervised by a Beth Din which is a rabbinical court in the city or jurisdiction where one lives This page deals with the Conflict of Laws or civil law implications vs Judaic Law religious law when a women does not get her ghet and is kept in agunah which means chained For a discussion of the purely religious implications see religious divorce Discussion Jewish communities have maintained a strong desire for religious cultural and economic autonomy Jewish Law is administered and enforced Judaic Lawin Israel and in the Diaspora through Bet Dins Houses of Judges Judaic Law holds that the man must initiate the request for the Jewish Divorce get and the woman must agree to receive the get The relationship between state and religion Jewish law or religious law is not justiciable in societies with the civil law doctrine of separation of Church and State which can sometimes cause conflict for women who remain in agunah One of the most common divorce difficulties is that a spouse can be held in a limping marriage when the other spouse refuses co operation in the religious form of divorce see Agunah A civil divorce can be obtained through local courts which entitles the parties to remarry civilly but the capacity to remarry is also religious question Where one party has the power to grant or withhold a religious divorce this power can be used as a bargaining tool to pressure the other party to agree more or less favourable terms for residence and contact with children and for maintenance and property settlements Such provisions produce a conflict between the human rights of the woman to be free to marry and the freedom of people to practise their religion see Article 18 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights which is repeated almost word for word in Article 9 1 European Convention on Human Rights International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief The difficulty is that most countries operate under constitutions based on a separation between church and state which forbid governments from interfering in the practice of religion within their territory unless the behaviour of one or more parties is in breach of the local civil or criminal law Thus for example in Rhodesia the case of Berkowitz v Berkowitz 1956 3 SA 522 SR held that it was inappropriate to use contempt proceedings to force a husband to grant a get because anything concerned exclusively with religious formalities was outside the jurisdiction of the secular courts Nevertheless the majority of Western states do to some extent make the secular court s response to matrimonial proceedings conditional on the relevant party taking the steps necessary to complete a religious divorce on fair terms so that either the court will impose excessively generous orders for maintenance and property settlement or deny access to a civil decree or to ancillary relief until the religious formalities have been completed Canada In Canada following consultation with all major religious groups the Divorce Act was amended in 1985 to add Section 21 1 to give the courts have the power to dismiss any application and strike out any pleadings and affidavits filed by a spouse who has failed to remove religious barriers to the remarriage of the other spouse The legislature intended to place spouses on a more equal footing in civil divorce actions encourage women in particular to exercise fully their rights under the law and maintain the integrity of the Divorce Act 1985 by helping to ensure that refusing to accept or to give a religious divorce was not used as a bargaining tool to gain unfair concessions on child custody and access or monetary support This reflects a general strong response at a federal level to any elements of duress or undue influence within the civil law system Bruker v Marcovitz The justiciability of a civil contract with religious overtonese is now being tested in the Supreme Court Case of Bruker v Marcovitz See Canadian Civil,0.010168947,0.005443518,0.0040869922,0.00059176696,0.0022591562,0.005581497

0,Regarding workstations servers and mainframes I believe that workstations and servers are classes of computers not sizes For example consider the IBM Power 595 It is a server is it not From the page IBM seems to think so and it certainly fits the definition of a server with that being a computer that provides a service s to client s Now consider the IBM Power 520 This too is a server is it not IBM thinks so and it fits the definition However the Power 595 is not a desktop It is nowhere near a desktop It is a rackmount IBM speak framemount server as evidenced by its dimensions 201 4 cm x 77 5 cm x 180 6 cm and weight 1 552 kg I will personally give anyone who can fit this on an average office desk from Ikea a cookie Now the Power 520 is not a rackmount server It is nowhere near a rackmount server It is a deskside server as evidenced by its dimensions 540 mm x 182 328 mm x 628 mm and weight 40 8 kg I will personally give anyone who can convince a Fortune 500 company that the Power 520 is a top of the line rackmount server a cookie Two very different machines both in hardware and form factor but they are still both classed as a server Clearly as evidenced by this servers can be in many form factors A server can be a desktop but it is not exclusively a desktop How the article is currently written seems to suggest that it is A server can also be a rackmount a tower a blade a deskside and a pedestal to name a few Workstations also come in more form factors than just desktop Many servers are desktops as in horizontal and are small and light enough to be placed on a desk the second more historical definition of a desktop However they can also be in a deskside tower rackmountable or pedestal form factor just to name a few This can be remedied by not using classes to determine size Instead use form factors such as blade rackmount deskside etc,0.0066448315,0.0037641083,0.011856898,0.000589477,0.0017944804,0.005469228

0,Very soon we all will find more about who you are 76 168 70 147 Public Statement by Mark Bellinghaus regarding the bias edits and tries to further slander him and his colleagues You continue to edit out three important articles that were printed and published in the Los Angeles Times Why Instead you are pushing for a blog post which is absolute nonsense You are adding a two piece article which is a one sided attack on me Mark Bellinghaus I have never had a dispute with Brandon James since I have not contacted him as he claimed in the article published by the OC Register They also published other lies which since have been removed due to my protest and conversation with their attorney Please edit in good faith and stick to the truth I will file a protest with Wikipedia because what is happening is a continuation of the planned out in detail slander character defamation and assassination by a small group of people who are obviously connected to and behind the fraud crimes the criminal hoaxes which we exposed and debunked This article is literally a stage for book projects such as June DiMaggio s and Jeanne Carmen s Maybe the time has come that we must also expose the real person behind Delicious carbuncle Again I knew that I would become the target of the criminals who I stopped screwing over the general public with their gimmicks attached to the legacy of Marilyn Monroe But I will use my clear and given right to defend what we three people who did care and worked for this for the past three years have achieved and succeeded with The LA TIMES articles must be added to this article and the CITIZEN is a dead blog which was a favor favour posted by a friend this is how this lady introduced herself to me on the phone when she called me up of Kenneth Knoll the friend and manager of the June DiMaggio book project She quoted me out of context and she admitted to me that she is NOT a press agency or journalist Regarding the Brandon James claims which you willingly added I have never spoken to Brandon James ever since I was introduced to him and his mother in 2005 He followed me to every blog every website Attacked us hidden behind monikers What is happening here right now is an example of some bias people who have created this to destroy our credibility It is a sad act of cutting off our freedom of speech and also trying to diminish our success in terms of the fraud exposures Who is behind this We do know exactly who is and we already have taken action And that exposure is way more interesting than anything we have taken on in the past It has also to do with cyber bullying since I am being portrayed as a monster I am being compared to Charles Manson and Berkowitz and that website was posted anonymously in Malaysia These people want me to go the Megan Meier way They have already told me to kill myself Not once but twice They have called me a pedophile and other insults They have claimed that I made bomb threats when I have never ever threatened anyone At all I have never extorted anyone You people hiding behind your funny and also so believable names you know why you are doing this and why you are using Wikipedia to destroy my name completely When I protested on the 45th anniversary of Marilyn Monroe s death outside the chapel I had my reason Three people were threatened and harassed by the Monroe 6 Version 2007 gang of people who threatened me to come to my home tie me on a chair duct tape me and steal my collection They were not shy to even include the AIDS infected blood by one of the members One of the people who is part of this group is now hiding behind this Wikipedia moniker and we positively have received confirmation that this female from Canada a woman which I have never met in personis part of this gang of super obsessive fans who on top of this also have created have thought out these many frauds hoaxes crimes I am asking you that if you decide to keep this site up and going NOT to use it to destroy our success in terms of our exposures I never thought that the power of blog could bring down the biggest exhibition fraud in history but it did Success so simple created and achieved naturally delivers a lot of haters Jealousy is one thing but facts and achievements are another It is one thing to post hateful comments about someone and to claim that Mark Bellinghaus mentally ill and other worse things and to post these hater attacks with monikers such as all of these people do itin known Lori Drew manner But it is unfair and it is also liable to post lies on a website which is nothing else than the revenge of a group,0.02091384,0.009941063,0.0016683928,0.0006095327,0.0018233707,0.0055782585

0,Re Tryptofish discussion I completely agree with your red pill explanation of the problem and I think you have a good handle on the problem But just like in The Matrix few people could handle going down the rabbit hole I think Trypto felt like you were attacking him for his arbcom opinion and he s pretty sensitive about such things I think you re correct about Kudpung but there are several differert ways to make your point without directly attacking Trypto For example you could have informed him that according to Kudpung s absurd recall criteria Trypto is no longer allowed to participate in the recall process Of course criticizing Kudpung is like shooting fish in a barrel so it s not very sporting This is a guy who claimed quite unbelievably that the Wifione case was a good reason to keep the tools bundled and adminship as high a bar as possible in the very face of evidence that showed otherwise Wifione was able to get away with mischief for five years precisely because adminship is an elite process that protects and rallies around its own If the tools had been debundled Wifione would have been desysopped at the first sign of trouble Trypto probably isn t aware of any of this or Kudpung s hilarious recall page which is literally designed to prevent anyone from recalling him Go read it if you don t believe me,0.099354945,0.006587081,0.0026814856,0.0006074868,0.0023825967,0.0056115314

0,The Loeb edition bears the inside title after the 50pp of introductory material Ammiani Marcellini Rerum Gestarum libri qui supersunt The volume titles are merely Ammianus Marcellinus although they include no other work by him since none has survived This inside title translates as The books that survive of the Deeds Acts History of Ammian Marcellinus Nowhere have I been able to find where this Latin title comes from I can t remember reading or hearing anyone actually refer to AM s History as Res Gestae although that s a Latin phrase that can be translated history The Divi Augustae sic on the other hand is a much clearer mistake which should have been so to speak Divi Augusti although FWIW not very much one can find RG Divi Augustae online Still it s not right and anyhow RGDA always refers to the piece of Augustan propaganda I ll revert the Loeb Reference although my edition doesn t have the same ISBN numbers prolly better to leave those off,0.0024673927,0.0065871095,0.0021559072,0.0005880685,0.0019267658,0.0054862243

0,Another theory of mine owner of this site the reason why Doug has now appeared out of nowhere is due to the fact that the other 2 people couldn t revert after a certain point or else they would break this 3 edit rule Notice how now this fellow Doug has appeared blocked then reverted the last edit I made This I believe is an error of the system It allows people to collaborate The reality is Roux I suspect has some agenda Wikipedia must understand that the Trance scene is currently being sidestepped by the House scene in a major way Mainland Europe as of 2011 has practically lost it s Trance festivals The rosters on the mainstages are almost exclusively House now Trance generally has contained since the year 2000 some of the most loyal drones in the dance market The type of people who dislike anything outside of Trance music Almost obsessive compulsive types I suspected this behavior in Pengowl originally also Then Roux appeared Both of them would monitor anytime I appeared on the page Trance followers often dislike much attachment to House because the House scene has practically overshadowed the whole Trance scene currently and due to the fact that House came first This may give a certain editor Roux certain agenda s to have cited information silenced or to disqualify a citation I suspected Roux was a Trance follower from his comments on Paul Oakenfold and also the clues telling me what year he entered the scene I am guessing 1992 or even later Trance scene actually started 1987 1988 There also are other possible motives for deleting my important entry So once again Wikipedia owner this is likely the reason why Roux is trying to find some rule or anything he can to prevent that one sentence and those two citations from being included Why Because they demonstrate that the earliest published Trance works are actually from the UK Acid House movement thus one can conclude that Trance had origins from the English House scene which Trance people would HATE WITH A PASSION Right now the world is to believe that it comes from mainland Europe only there is zero reference to England which in fact had one of if not the largest Trance scenes in the early years Information is just information I personally don t have any pure attachment to House or Trance I enjoy both but one must speak about the origins To silence the past is in a way misinforming an entire generation of newcomers to the scene Few people can speak about the past because those early critical warehouse years were the beginnings of the scene What may sound like a few years to you in reality there is a big difference to someone who appeared in the scene in 1987 as opposed to someone who appeared in 1992 It is also difficult for anyone to speak of the origins of Trance without living through classic Chicago House in the 1980 s There is little to no documentation on the early years of Trance The documentation that does exist is often written from the perspective of DJs or writers who did not live through classic Chicago House therefore it is difficult for them to piece together the past To speak of the actual catalog releases of the creators of the music is extremely important in my opinion In fact the records themselves the only medium that the art was released through in the early years are the actual only true un biased reference to the genre wouldn t you agree At the end of the day Trance doesn t exist in space it exists in published form contained on a vinyl record I am not sure why the site would want me to avoid speaking about the creators of that art,0.10721148,0.044141997,0.0010827814,0.00057605916,0.00211075,0.005721285

0,The source he is referring to is likely this the article I discovered The reason I invited the wider view mentioning that other political parties are involved in violence is because it gives the reader a greater understanding of the elements at play Just as if one were to read about sea stars and there is a mention that they eat phytoplankton mentioning that jellyfish also eat phytoplankton might be useful for greater understanding of the sea stars are they in the same waters do they compete for food To present this information as if CPI M members are singular in their violence is not a correct viewpoint if violence is ongoing between many parties In another example if we were to present a fistfight between a man in a red shirt and a man in a white shirt when they both were arrested for fighting If we reported that as The man in the red shirt was striking the man in the white shirt repeatedly until eventually he was arrested is not neutral because it gives undue weight to only one portion of a greater conflict not informing the reader of all the information they could otherwise have As to your other question What wiki policy prohibits use of only one source if the source is reliable for the type of information the source is providing here then it may not be correct for it to be prohibited If other reliable sources disagree about the existence of Harmath then we d have a different avenue to go However this is the Wikipedia policy I am currently the most concerned with If Harmath is truly only supported by a single source mentioning them unequivocally as a militant arm of the party based on that one source might be undue weight Saying One source claimed that an organization called Harmath is a militant arm might be better but we must take care not to use that as a gateway to simply reprint the article here If there is but one source the weight that this should be given is likely minimal Does that properly speak to my viewpoints 72 192 46 9,0.08095483,0.050462864,0.009446654,0.00059061305,0.0014774743,0.005560433

0,Hi Howard and all the rest of you guys Americans or d ailleurs I favor Howard s proposal of having an article to list all of the third party participants in the Iran Iraq War not just a separate article for U S I was kidding when I said that adding U S to both sides would fix the infobox but not kidding in the sense that if someone sticks U S in one side the history shows U S should be in both sides I am inclusionist with respect to the infobox and think that anybody who moved arms to either side should be included All of this is hashed out ad naseum above but the new Iranian guy has kicked it all off again by throwing U S into the info box once again bringing us back into the grand and glorious infobox debate territory Also there are two other guys C Suit and B Louie going into endless debates about a single Iranian war slogan something like Onward beans and bagels fight fight fight for Palestine or something like that that one insists is real and the other insists is invented but I can t for the life of me figure out why either of them considers it worthy of so much debate Oh yes the slogan is We will keep fighting until we win You d hope so don t you think What else would they say We will keep fighting until we stop fighting or whatever That would not be a very effective slogan Is there some way we can combine the slogan debate and the infobox debate into one huge bonfire of nitpicking I d like that Thanks,0.45758522,0.14019787,0.0021469644,0.00069081405,0.0019423512,0.009195692

0,The text about German historical school has promoted and spread a theory that Slavs settled in the Balkans in the 6th century meant to undermine the Serb presence and significance in the area during the Roman era is a conspiracy theory and it would be pretty hard to find sources other than perhaps a couple from Belgrade which support such rants Linguistic evidence I could cite a reputable source here but the name alone would spark more drama hints at Albanian Slav contact before the end of the ninth century when there was a vowel shift in local Slavic language Some loanwords in Albanian were taken before that vowel shift However Albanians Kosovo and Slavs Serbs of course However all this is relevant to many different articles because the history of the region is told over and over again in different ways on different pages so we should probably discuss it somewhere more central if we re planning to make serious improvements,0.6604272,0.0297178,0.015702927,0.00057585386,0.0018519891,0.0055667222

0,I received a notification of this discussion on my phone on my home from work I have read the article and while it is a worthy student essay it is not encyclopaedic in tone and as well as the editorialisng there are errors The discussion on rotavirus immediately grabbed my attention It s about 20 years out of date and is sourced to a 1985 paper by de Zoysa and Feachem This publication was important and influential at the time but has long been superseded There has been major progress in prevention of rotaviral diarrhoea in the past 15 or so years which the article completely ignores It has also been known for some time that improved social conditions do little to control the incidence and prevalence of viral gastroenteritis and this is why the WHO many years ago supported vaccine development I m not convinced that there is much here once it has been updated and the editorial comments removed that is not already covered in our other articles which include Gastroenteritis Rotavirus and Rotavirus vaccine While I applaud the contributor s enthusiasm for a subject that has been the main thrust of my research in real life I think the salient points of this article should be merged with Gastroenteritis if they are not already covered I don t think this contribution is worthy of a stand alone article and certainly not a GA,0.0050898697,0.0038263807,0.001424235,0.0005687694,0.0017338945,0.005486948

0,18 January 2007 UTC Oh you dont say I think you will find it very clear from everything I have contributed towards on wikipedia that concerns this subject that I am the one who has clarrified that it was a Muslim Christian conflict And no once again you are very biased and lack alot of knowledge about your own faith Yes there were Europeans the west what were they then Africans Asians that part of the world is called Europe The crusaders came from all over Europe so get that right for starters And let me tell you this these muslims who were invading Byazantinian lands were the people of the middle east who were conquered by the byzantinians These pleaing byzantinians along with the ROMAN catholics were all trinitarian christians and remenat of the pagan Roman Religeon due to the inevitable spread of true jesuit unitarian christianity the roman empire found itself in a critical position and had to adopt the christian faith and embed it in their previous pagan beliefs hence the celebration of sunday rather than the jesuit saturday sunday was tthe holy day for pagan romans The cross a pagan roman sign never adopted by jesus the fish a pagan Egyptian sign adopted by the romans the trinity the whole tihing about the vatican in rome etc etc were massacring the indigenous people of the levant which they occupied who were mostly unitarian sects of christianity and the followers of the more accurate versions of the gospel which weree written fairly shortly after Jesus s ascent not the centuries old heavily altered versions you follow These Unitarians had prophecies in their gospels of the coming of a final prophet and the signs and times pointed to Mohammad and most of them adopted Islam because they knew Mohammad was their prophet as prophesized by Jesus The byzantinians romans were killing them and there familys and they were deemed by the church at the councils of nicea as heretics so the mass population who were invaded by romans were indeed monotheistic Unitarians The Muslims liberated these people of the land from the tyrant byzantinians Even under Islamic rule the roman minority citizens were left to live in peace amongst the Muslims and a testimony to this is the fact that these same roman minorities still live on in the middle east Jerusalem was sacked ny the romans and its people liberated by the Muslims And were YOU aware that the inquisition which by the way you put it acted independantly from the church stop lying the church was the ultimate ruler as everyone knows which murdered science and scientists and had complete control over everyone as seen by the call to the crusades You are an apologetic not muslims everything was done in the name of the church why even colonialists came into countries and plundered them with priests accompanying them You claim it has nothing to do with the church and I never said that the inquisition was called for by the pope where did you get that rubbish from dont put words in my mouth however up until the 18th 19th century the bodies and skeletons of muslims and heretics killed by the inquisition were still hangig from the ceilings of churches The church is the one who deems people as heretics and is the one who approved of the killings full stop Please dont try to correct me before you yourself go and do some academic unbiased research like I did most of my sources were non muslim sources that were ballanced obviously unlike you And about the pope issuing edicts against the killing of muslims or Jews well what do you mean THE pope dont you mean A pope there were many you know And this is about the inquisittion and not the pope perhaps a pope at a different time to the inquisition said that they logically shouldnt kill other people like barbarians Im not doubting you but it would be helpful if you could mention the name Again dont go off the topic this was about hte inquisition And yes I bloomin love life under Islam as a woman I feel liberated and free and as an environmentallist and a concerned person for childrens rights i feel supported and as a lover of logic and equality I feel I found the truth there was a debate in the church at one point and they were discussing whether or not women were humans If it wasnt for Islam the motor wouldnt have been invented the crank shaft tall buildings dur to architectural techniques education including higher education for all sexes classes and colours merit was becasue of knowledge and not wealth and there is so much more that is owed to them basically we would have stil been living in huts right now if it wasnt for them and dont forget that the romans forcibly converted us to roman christianity when they invaded us I love Islam and YOU are showing everybody how ignorant YOU are by exposing your complete lack of knowledge and trying to stray off the arguame,0.7381106,0.106362484,0.0022376166,0.013379448,0.0024015424,0.006807683

0,District of Safed Hi regarding your edit at Dallata Because there are quite a few examples of more than one village in Palestine of the same name we usually identify which district of Palestine it was in sometimes even in the article name The unwritten convention among the editors who work on the village articles is to use the 1945 8 districts since that is what most modern sources use See Districts of the British Mandate of Palestine last section where you will notice that we should be calling them sub districts rather than districts Also writing that a village was in Mandatory Palestine won t do since that entity only lasted about 25 years but most of the villages were there for centuries Saying that they were in Palestine would be more accurate It can be confusing but I think Palestine along with the past tense is about the best short solution What are your thoughts please reply here talk,0.03516403,0.011735968,0.0013989041,0.00058114255,0.0018740464,0.0055153384

0,I think one of my points of confusion is that when a different jammer moves into scoring position the announcers will yell So and So is the new lead jammer Which raises the point that a jammer in the lead is not from E writes above the lead jammer just the jammer in the lead A problem when a term of art utilizes a word as common as lead Again I ask for validation that I understand this situation lead jammer is NOT EQUAL to jammer in the lead,0.005273884,0.04208344,0.003019989,0.00060081517,0.0016564722,0.006799727

0,February 2008 UTC Thanks for the improvements you have made to Shadow Circus The article is certainly better I would urge you to continue to work on it though because its claim to notability via Zach Tenorio is still weak It appears that Tenorio has played onstage with some well known artists but the references I was able to find via Google show he was one of several people who played briefly onstage on one occasion This really doesn t meet the Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable criteria of WP BAND since he was never a member of those other bands in the sense meant by our guideline Since that s the only notability criteria that the article currently depends on its a pretty thin justification for the article I will keep an eye on the article and I hope you can find better sources for it and improve the case for Shadow Circus being notable If you can t its likely that I or another editor will nominate it for discussion as an article for deletion and I fear in its current state it may not be kept Good luck 18 10 8,0.0039541037,0.0051005343,0.00037572163,0.0005744501,0.0015661162,0.00548124

0,Tram and trolleybus articles Thanks for your comments I have been a big fan of electric powered urban and rail transport particularly in continental Europe since the early 1980s and that of course is the subject matter of the newly translated template and the articles that are and will be linked to it Until recently en wiki did not have anywhere near as good a coverage of Italian rail topics as it should have Although I can t speak Italian and can barely read it translating Italian is relatively easy with the assistance of Google translator Since November last year I have therefore translated approximately 100 articles about individual Italian railway stations Now that almost all of the important stations are covered in en wiki the it wiki articles about Italian tram networks and trolleybus systems seemed to be the logical next step Since I started work on my latest project I have also discovered that there is very comprehensive coverage of individual tramway networks and trolleybus systems in de wiki so I will start translating some of the de wiki articles soon In the meantime I have just created one very long overdue en wiki article Trams in Milan not fully translated as yet and will be creating another long overdue article in the next few days Which brings me to a query about nomenclature There s quite a bit of material on both it wiki and de wiki about individual classes of trams and trolleybuses However I m not sure how translations of those articles should be named If an article is about a generic make and model eg Siemens Desiro then it can just be named as make model But if a tram class is unique to a particular network the issue of naming is less clear There are several en wiki articles about Australian trams that are named in the following form W class Melbourne tram However that form doesn t seem right to me I would suggest that a more appropriate form would be Milan series 1500 tram which is a form consistent with the naming of many articles about locomotives eg British Rail Class 47 What do you think,0.0036155644,0.006329221,0.0021561207,0.0005857788,0.001684116,0.0054662847

0,As much as human rights and ethnic rights should be respected spray painting every possible detail of unverifiable information on the Rohingya and getting around the verification by claiming that the information was destroyed by an interested party are not valid reasons for having a list of villages where a certain group of people live There is already a lot of articles on the Arakanese people and state that have no concern of the Rohingya but include them for the sake of brotherly respect this is pushing the line a bit far Rohingyas should be treated fairly I do not contest that But articles like this one are pure self pitying and clutters Wikipedia with absolutely useless information I wonder when will somebody change the name of the article on Burma Myanmar on wiki to Country where the Rohingya are Persecuted Rather a brief mention of where the Rohingyas reside should be placed if desired on the main article on Rakhine state albeit short and concise not dump an entire list of names copied directly from some publication With all due respect this article should be deleted,0.45380968,0.014366743,0.015129976,0.0009378132,0.0028647536,0.0055344747

0,Severed vs cut in two Editor made the change from severed to cut in two Cut in two is actually more accurate and his explanation was also correct Severed isn t quite correct I realize that there was a book on Short published under the title Severed it s in my library in fact But if you look closely at the definition of sever Short s body wasn t really severed it was cut in two Definition of sever from Webster s to put or keep apart divide especially to remove as a part by or as if by cutting To put or keep apart is accurate when referring to people who have severed relationships Divide especially to remove as a part doesn t fit what happened to Short s body because her body wasn t divided into parts but actually bisected With all of this in mind I think that if severed is insisted on and kept the words in two need to be added I will be making that addition after I am finished with this talk page entry More discussion here would be a good thing Thanks,0.0072033363,0.008773583,0.0020746526,0.00058328843,0.0014478839,0.005580931

0,Hi Thatcher I think this could be directly submitted to the committee since the identity confirmation isn t an issue anymore from what Grandmaster said that Ehud is an Azerbaijani user and from Atabek s words about the fact that anyone could choose any username of their liking If this confirms that Ehud Lesar is not an Ehud Lesar then any evidence provided to the arbitration in secret is not a confirmation Because at this point if it is true that Ehud is not claiming to be an Ehud Lesar anymore if it is Adil he can ask anyone to provide identity to have him return because he doesn t need to prove he is Ehud Lesar So this case should be taken to judge if there is sufficient evidence that Ehud is Adil or not Contacting the arbitration in secret could lead the arbitration to take a wrong decision because they may not know the full situation or we may not know anything so this will prevent the possibility of more evidences being provided,0.01963669,0.0043253577,0.0052737035,0.00059797085,0.0017562389,0.005548343

0,I am a bit confused you seemed to have taken things rather personally and resorted to ad hominem attacks You accuse me of trying to start and edit war when in fact I started this section in the discussion page to avoid an edit war I have made sure to avoid any violation of the 3RR policy so how exactly was this an edit war Certainly the article has been edited numerous times since the discussion started but that is the point of the discussion Discussion is not supposed to prevent editing entirely but to facilitate healthy editing which ultimately improves the articles rather than pointless reverts back and forth I am also confused about why you think I attacked you because I never did I did follow WP AGF but assume good faith does not mean I have to assume you are correct I assumed you were doing your best to contribute to the article but I also believed you were mistaken and did my best to clarify these mistakes I even mentioned that your argument was true to some degree which hardly sounds like an argument containing personal attacks Also I assume you wrote your last paragraph before checking the most recent update to the article because I had already done exactly what you suggested It seems like we have come to an agreement so I don t see why any further accusations that I am some sort of troll are necessary Hopefully you won t take criticism and constructive contributions to a discussion so personally I know sometimes with text the tone can come of as sarcastic and or patronizing when that was not the authors original intent but that is exactly why we have the Assume Good Faith policy so that tempers don t get out of hand when the tone of a discussion becomes ambiguous like that 129 116 39 44,0.011837789,0.010884125,0.00094443053,0.00057856744,0.0015713584,0.005450314

0,Definition I m not happy with the definition as it stands and I would like to see a reference for the assertion that Horslips were the first to name the genre Celtic in modern usage means more than the Ancient Celts and much music that involves the lives of Modern Celts is considered Celtic Thus there s no reason a band like The Pogues who sung frequently about Irish matters should be considered less Celtic simply because they were focused on the present Similarly I see no reason Horslips driving hard rock is more suited towards being real Celtic Rock than the blues influenced music of L era Fairport,0.011527986,0.014926767,0.0018376942,0.0006138866,0.0016483772,0.005492011

0,This is the text i struggle to post in G 91 page Just to realize how i want to contribute to wiki and how someone don t want i do it The Aeritalia G 91 also known as the Fiat G 91 and nicknamed Gina was an light Italian fighter aircraft that was intended to serve as standard equipment for NATO air forces in the 1960s It was eventually only adopted by three the Italian Air Force West Germany s Luftwaffe and the Portuguese Air Force but enjoyed a long service life that extended over 35 years Development In 1953 European aircraft manufacturers were invited by NATO to submit aircraft for evaluation for the Light Weight Strike Fighter LWSF role The G 91 was designed to the specification by the famous Italian engineer Giuseppe Gabrielli hence the G designation The competition was intended to produce an aircraft that was light small expendable equipped with basic weapons and avionics and capable of operating with minimal ground support These specifications were developed for two reasons the first was the nuclear threat and the other was to counter the trend towards larger and more expensive aircraft The technical requirements were 1 100 m take off distance over a 15 m obstacle Capability to operate from grass strips and streets Max speed of 0 95 Mach Range of 280 km with 10 min over the target Armoured protection for the pilot and the fuel tanks 4x12 7 mm or 2x20 mm or 30 mm guns A maximum of 2 200 kg empty weight and 4 700 kg max weightFerrari 1992 p 83 The challengher proposals must had been presented within two months after the request The projecting work was only apparently an easy task because making a very small aircraft yet capable to cover these NATO specifications was difficult Fiat Aviazione presented G 91 and so did other competitors with a total of 10 projects analysed since 18 March by AGARD Advisory Group for Aeronautical Research and Development led by Theodore Von Karman The finalists were declared Breguet Taon Dassault Etendard Fiat G 91 and Folland Gnat Another interesting project was Sud Aviation Badoleur that solved drastically the problem of a proper landing undercarriage simply omitted and sobstitued with a landing and take off skid aircraft was moved in ground operations with a special trailer This however was not ufficially presented to AGARD that choose on paper the Taon as winner In the meanwhile there was the problem of the engine that must been light yet enough powerful and reliable with easy and cheap maintenance like the whole aircraft The solution was realized by Bristol with the Bristol Orpheus a simple and effective turbojet It was adopted to all the finalists so Bristol will won the contest in every case G 91R presented by Fiat was also called little Sabre It was due by the knowledge gained with license production of a modern aircraft the F 86K that helped to make much experience with advanced jet aircrafts It was similar to F 86 as overall design but smaller and capable to operate from semi prepared airstrips G 91R was 20 heavier than the estimates and this was due partly to testing hardware but it was powered by a Bristol Orpheus B Or 801 1 800 kg t It was yet capable to supersonic speed in dives as shown by the flight made in 20 February 1957 when it was able to break the sound barrier four times with 9 000 m dives His test pilot Riccardo Bignamini a famous one of that times he won McKenna Trophy at Empire Test School was a key element to solve the G 91 shortcomings and the first flight was made in 9 August 1956 at Torino Caselle airfield Few days after it was tested at high speed and at 1 300 m ceiling but lost control and Bignamini w,0.0071076388,0.005690573,0.0016538233,0.010885936,0.0028561566,0.005550288

0,That quote discusses what happens to the penis after circumcision which is not what the article is about The sentence may use the word foreskin but it is clearly a quote that is directly related to circumcision rather than the foreskin thus it is off topic and does not belong in the article The only part of the sentence directly related to the foreskin is nerve endings in the foreskin and that section by itself doesn t add much to the article Allowing material that discusses what happens to the penis after the foreskin is removed would allow the entire Sexual effects of circumcision and Medical analysis of circumcision articles to be copied to Foreskin When taken to this extreme it s quite evident that discussing what happens to the penis when the foreskin is removed is beyond the scope of this article If readers wish to learn about what happens to the penis when the foreskin is removed there are plenty of circumcision related pages that are directly related to that topic on wikipedia and we already link to them from the Foreskin article It appears that the article is being used as a soapbox for discussing circumcision because of the number of sentences devoted to circumcision in the article If it was just one or two sentences I would not have a basis for making this accusation but as we can see from this diff your revert conveniently shows all three of my edits so I m using that rather than listing them individually the amount of off topic text devoted to circumcision is substantial By the way since we re discussing content again I m happy to go back to the Foreskin talk page so that other editors can participate in the conversation Thanks for continuing our discussion I think we re getting somewhere again However I also note that you have now been reverted by two other editors indicating a lack of consensus for including the material in question so I m not sure if further discussion is necessary but I m happy to continue the discussion if you wish,0.009286674,0.3441577,0.020664692,0.0005825193,0.0015965787,0.005551328

0,Records of Awesome Editors Who Truly Want To Help As this is not a study of people s hesitancy it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for people s hesitancy It would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves not a study about hesitancy or about controversy If this study is the reason for people s hesitancy then we should be pointing to a reliable third party source that states that it s the reason not to the study itself If we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film Jaws we use as a reference the source that makes that statement not the film itself So no it s not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for Nat Gertler talk That has got to be the clearest explanation yet So what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality then cite both sources Or should I use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article Even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece Is this where wiki gets the facts from opinions then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is WP OR It is built by popular opinion of the editors from opinion pieces not allowing facts if this is indeed true though I hope notDcrsmama talk No I m not saying cite both sources References are there to verify the facts that are being stated in Wikipedia s voice If the statement being sourced is that there is a controversy due to correlation with infant mortality then we cite a source that is discussing the controversy there is no need to cite the study Even if the source says that there is a controversy because of this particular study we might mention this study in the text but the study itself is not reference for the statement And I am addressing the specific request for input that you made in your initial posting If you have concerns about the other sources in the article you may wish to raise them in a specific post about the specific concerns Nat Gertler talk From WP RPS,0.08801089,0.021490458,0.008201924,0.0006712426,0.0015102727,0.0056511266
0,The use of an IP address rather than even a username is often a clever device that serves a multitude of purposes An established username allows you to look at their other contributions and perhaps discern some clues as to their identity or affiliation On the other hand a relatively new account if the user demonstrates experience knowledge with Wikipedia can provoke allegations of sockpuppetry If the new user does not demonstrate experience knowledge with Wikipedia he is pretty much harmless as he will be ineffective in pushing his POV since he cannot game the system through his familiarity with the rules and norms An IP address provides the opportunity to disclaim responsibility for edits since they could have been made by someone else using the same terminal and if the IP address shifts can make it difficult to figure out which edits are being made by whom,0.02661494,0.003500134,0.0030086124,0.0005724713,0.001894594,0.0057566757

0,Kmccoy I agree with you If you look at my changes today I included only the birth dates of the two children who are now adults one of whom has a Wikipedia article already with three independent sources for Track s birth date of 20 April 1989 and I included the birth date for baby Trig since he was SO MUCH in the news last year I was trying to find a compromise position There is no consensus here for including or for excluding and if you read previous talk pages you will see no consensus there either In the spirit of erring on the side of more information Wikipedia s mission is to inform after all I made today s revision The immediate reversion wiping out all birth dates except that of little Tripp Johnston certainly the most irrelevant birth date of all is a bit risible and does not demonstrate any consensus either As for the sources I shall find better ones but that argument is a red herring No one has found any other birth date for Track other than 20 April 1989 All the sources weaker or stronger agree on the birth date I have read WP UNDUE It supports including neutral factual information Birth dates fall into that category I really don t see where the problem is here I shall not continue to include the birth dates in the article but this demonstrates that Wiki articles need more consistent management It is troubling that there is a small minority who insist upon exclusion when Wikipedia should stand for inclusion,0.011622056,0.004916082,0.0011954268,0.0007034131,0.0018905426,0.006217523

0,Hi Tom Funny one I don t see the note below that you refer to As far as insertion of the info in the lead sentence see the note above our conversation for my thoughts The Wiki policy that I refer to which is the focus of some people who focus more on their view of required format than they do on what is AWK no doubt largely causes this problem I expect you don t have a problem with mention that someone is Latvian say in the lead and do not view that as AWK And as you and our colleague in the above discussion point out it was seem non AWK to say Jewish or Jew either before or after the reference to Latvian But where some people s reading of the Wiki format direction stops us from doing this we are necessarily forced into a more awkward presentation What you say looks feels very awkward If I want to satisfy the format is most important people and I want to satisfy the AWK is most important people and still wish to reflect simply in the text that someone is Jewish with no greater emphasis than mention of the fact that they are Latvian I find that at times this can be challenging depending on whether the interested parties wish to make the article better or just like deleting or reverting the info without putting it in a form that works for them and others There are I expect one or two other groups of editors out there One group just wishes to delete mention of the fact generally that people are Jewish Another group wishes to delete mention of the fact that people are Jewish if they believe it will help or hurt the image of Jews that they wish to propogate These two group I expect do not indicate what their true interest is but cloak their arguments with psuedo rationale argumentation Personally while I personally support reflection that people are Jewish especially in the area of sportspeople I would not delete such a reference where the person in question is not one that the Jews might be proud to call their own If it notable as measured and this is important by reflection of the fact in multiple sources that are reliable and not connected then I have no problem with good or bad people being identified as Jews if that is the case the same as I have no problem with them being identified as Latvians I appreciate your comment that you are not trying to ethnically cleanse articles as you put it I just had some people delete a category that I created Jewish figure skaters It was deleted despite the fact that attempts to delete Jewish sportspeople and Jewish fencers with largely the same arguments recently by the same people did not result in deletion That is now up for deletion review If you could give me any thoughts as to your thinking on how to address this issue that would be great as well Cheers Have a great weekend,0.010286204,0.008567783,0.00078449777,0.00062848144,0.0019760486,0.005599852

0,Cardozo spoke Spanish fluently and could read and understand Portuguese He was an erudite person who demonstrated an interest in his Sephardic lineage although he apparently could never identify exactly whether his ancestors originated in Portugal or Spain in either case they would have been Iberian Jews themselves the descendents of Latin speaking Jews present in Iberia since Roman times Sonia Sotomayor is a light skinned Afro Puerto Rican which means many of her ancestors were forcibly removed from West Africa and transported as slaves to Cuba Puerto Rico and Santo Domingo she likely does not have the luxury of tracing her genealogy back through the centuries to Spain or any other part of Iberia unless she were inclined to investigate the history of the slave holders who owned her African ancestors and had sexual relations with them a not very uplifting undertaking 72 221 92 43,0.7953057,0.021872891,0.010513231,0.0006954064,0.015740987,0.0057966863

0,I m okay with Fletcher s approach frankly Yes there are relevant qualms about calling it a mosque since that s not all the planned center would be but there would be facilities for holding prayers and services and really the distinction between mosque and prayer room in this sense is a semantic distinction If there were a line in the first paragraph of the lead qualifying that it s not solely a mosque project and perhaps even the word mosque isn t strictly correct I m okay with the use of that word in the title But it has to say near Ground Zero NickCT s comment about how WP COMMONNAME should be the sole arbiter of this matter I think doesn t recognize that there is a spirit to the rules that trumps the letter of the rules Wikipedia is not a place to spread misinformation Calling the page Ground Zero Mosque despite the fact that the term misrepresents where the mosque facilities will be and despite the fact that reputable sources are choosing not to use the term because it misrepresents where the mosque facilities will be flies in the face of the idea that we re supposed to be reflecting what the WP RS sources are saying,0.0028214816,0.0075245886,0.00086201046,0.00064709596,0.011216287,0.008525559

0,I m in twothree minds over this proposal As regards redlinks on the one hand over the last two years of monitoring the topic I ve seen it used as a catalyst and incubator for new articles on the other hand it is arguable that a death reported in a WP RS is of a person of some note if not necessarily within our standards On the third hand we do get some no hopers on the face of it which is why we tend to allow a month for an interested editor to create an article and then delete undeveloped entries as non notable In the second case we perhaps should not interpret lack of interest as lack of notability because it may be that interested editors are lacking that s why the month moratorium seems to exist as far as I can tell andemu,0.0063827303,0.015579258,0.0016113897,0.00056932017,0.0014078063,0.0054872264

0,Hi We have three members already We all seem interested in the project I have created a template to place on article s talk pages An user from the Spanish WikiProject has just suggested that we translate articles from one Wikipedia to the other using an automatic translator but no one responded yet One of the members is interested in writing about gay literature and there has been somewhat of a discussion about whether it should be gay literature or LGBT literature I believe this was the first discussion of the project Two of us think that LGBT literature would be best I don t have a lot of time to dedicate to the project so I would like it if it didn t depend on me to survive and grow and be successful The other two members have asked what they can do for the project I would like to write something to better explain what a Wiki Project is for because this seems unclear I believe it s not much of a big deal it s just a way to have all people interested in the same subject in the same place so if something important happens concerning that subject for example a page gets nominated for deletion all interested people get to know It should also create a sense of community and it s good to have that since we ll be editing the same articles I think things are going fine except that I don t know whether the other members see this as I do,0.09445894,0.011519611,0.001259957,0.0006957594,0.0015335726,0.005684112

1,Well dear Ahasuerus It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you Where they can t kill you they censor you Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest but when the interest of Islam comes in they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail But that is another story This article started with some explanation like this In recent years especially after the 9 11 some observers including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non Islamic countries They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it the today s useful idiots Ali Sina states They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non Muslim countries and destroy them from within The same author writes More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die Trying to appease Muslims is foolish It is informed by ignorance of Islam Most cancers are treatable if detected in time But if ignored they will grow to a stage that will kill you Today we have the choice We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses Muslims obviously don t like Ali Sina For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality has yet to show that in actions I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her I have still to be convinced of that claim I found out that she is Iranian like Ali Sina but of course most Iranians are still Muslims She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her In Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all but generally critical views about Islam do not survive Why If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn t we give equal space to both sides Would we accept if e g scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult What is happening is very disturbing There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution hate speech What about the Quran Isn t that book a hate speech Funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules If you try to write anything that Muslims don t like they will delete it with invalid justifications This is a very disturbing trend For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because as they said he is not notable There are 200 000 pages talking about faith freedom international There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him Doesn t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published I am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed Sorry this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss Is there a place to do that My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion it loses its credibility fast 05 13 2,0.43353334,0.43239343,0.026776446,0.0012419086,0.0041987277,0.0066167717
